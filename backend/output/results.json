The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the \ninternal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room. Education of the medical staff and organiza-\ntion of the operating theatre facilitated the management of the patient without an increased risk of spreading the infection.\nConclusions\u2002 The current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary organization of the medical and surgical care of \nthe patients. It is possible to manage an infected or a potentially infected patient surgically, but a multidisciplinary plan is \nnecessary to protect other patients and the medical staff.\nKeywords\u2002 COVID-19\u00a0\u00b7 Emergency\u00a0\u00b7 Cervical fracture\u00a0\u00b7 Corona ward\u00a0\u00b7 Surgical planning\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nIn late 2019, a series of severe acute respiratory syndrome \n(SARS) was reported in China. The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms. Protective masks (FFP3 filtering facepiece particle \nFig.\u202f2\u2002 \u2009A 92-year-old female patient presenting with fracture-dislocation C6-7. Sagittal CT a, facet joint dislocation on the right side b, facet \njoint dislocation on the left side c, MRI examination d and postoperative X-ray showing reduction and fixation e\u200a\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n472\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\n3), head covers and eye goggles are adequately stocked in the \noperating rooms. The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation. Surgical team (a), anaesthesia team (b) and the operating room equipment (c)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n473\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\nthe neurological status was recorded (ASIA B). On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions. Tian et\u00a0al. [17] \nrecently published their experience with telerobotic spinal \nsurgery based on 5G technology. They performed remote \nsurgery in 12 cases and concluded that this technology could \nbuild a connection between surgeons and patients located in \nisolated or rural areas with a lack of medical resources. We \ndo not have experience with this technology; however, this \nmight be an attractive option in such pandemic situations \nprovided the necessary infrastructures are available.\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n474\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nElective spine operations, is\u00a0it the\u00a0right time?\nIn the last few weeks, the number of new cases is signifi-\ncantly reduced. We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.

The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the \ninternal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room. Education of the medical staff and organiza-\ntion of the operating theatre facilitated the management of the patient without an increased risk of spreading the infection.\nConclusions\u2002 The current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary organization of the medical and surgical care of \nthe patients. It is possible to manage an infected or a potentially infected patient surgically, but a multidisciplinary plan is \nnecessary to protect other patients and the medical staff.\nKeywords\u2002 COVID-19\u00a0\u00b7 Emergency\u00a0\u00b7 Cervical fracture\u00a0\u00b7 Corona ward\u00a0\u00b7 Surgical planning\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nIn late 2019, a series of severe acute respiratory syndrome \n(SARS) was reported in China. The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms. Protective masks (FFP3 filtering facepiece particle \nFig.\u202f2\u2002 \u2009A 92-year-old female patient presenting with fracture-dislocation C6-7. Sagittal CT a, facet joint dislocation on the right side b, facet \njoint dislocation on the left side c, MRI examination d and postoperative X-ray showing reduction and fixation e\u200a\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n472\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\n3), head covers and eye goggles are adequately stocked in the \noperating rooms. The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation. Surgical team (a), anaesthesia team (b) and the operating room equipment (c)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n473\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\nthe neurological status was recorded (ASIA B). On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions. Tian et\u00a0al. [17] \nrecently published their experience with telerobotic spinal \nsurgery based on 5G technology. They performed remote \nsurgery in 12 cases and concluded that this technology could \nbuild a connection between surgeons and patients located in \nisolated or rural areas with a lack of medical resources. We \ndo not have experience with this technology; however, this \nmight be an attractive option in such pandemic situations \nprovided the necessary infrastructures are available.\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n474\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nElective spine operations, is\u00a0it the\u00a0right time?\nIn the last few weeks, the number of new cases is signifi-\ncantly reduced. We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.

The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room.

The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms. Protective masks (FFP3 filtering facepiece particle \nFig.\u202f2\u2002 \u2009A 92-year-old female patient presenting with fracture-dislocation C6-7. Sagittal CT a, facet joint dislocation on the right side b, facet \njoint dislocation on the left side c, MRI examination d and postoperative X-ray showing reduction and fixation e\u200a\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n472\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\n3), head covers and eye goggles are adequately stocked in the \noperating rooms. The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation. Surgical team (a), anaesthesia team (b) and the operating room equipment (c)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n473\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\nthe neurological status was recorded (ASIA B). On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions. Tian et\u00a0al. [17] \nrecently published their experience with telerobotic spinal \nsurgery based on 5G technology. They performed remote \nsurgery in 12 cases and concluded that this technology could \nbuild a connection between surgeons and patients located in \nisolated or rural areas with a lack of medical resources. We \ndo not have experience with this technology; however, this \nmight be an attractive option in such pandemic situations \nprovided the necessary infrastructures are available.\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n474\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nElective spine operations, is\u00a0it the\u00a0right time?\nIn the last few weeks, the number of new cases is signifi-\ncantly reduced. We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.

The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the \ninternal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room.

The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms. Protective masks (FFP3 filtering facepiece particle \nFig.\u202f2\u2002 \u2009A 92-year-old female patient presenting with fracture-dislocation C6-7. Sagittal CT a, facet joint dislocation on the right side b, facet \njoint dislocation on the left side c, MRI examination d and postoperative X-ray showing reduction and fixation e\u200a\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n472\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\n3), head covers and eye goggles are adequately stocked in the \noperating rooms. The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation. Surgical team (a), anaesthesia team (b) and the operating room equipment (c)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n473\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\nthe neurological status was recorded (ASIA B). On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions. Tian et\u00a0al. [17] \nrecently published their experience with telerobotic spinal \nsurgery based on 5G technology. They performed remote \nsurgery in 12 cases and concluded that this technology could \nbuild a connection between surgeons and patients located in \nisolated or rural areas with a lack of medical resources. We \ndo not have experience with this technology; however, this \nmight be an attractive option in such pandemic situations \nprovided the necessary infrastructures are available.\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n474\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nElective spine operations, is\u00a0it the\u00a0right time?\nIn the last few weeks, the number of new cases is signifi-\ncantly reduced. We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.

Thun, MD, MS\nABSTRACT\nEach year, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates the number of new\ncancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the\nmost recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from\nthe National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North\nAmerican Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center\nfor Health Statistics. This report considers incidence data through 2003 and mortality data\nthrough 2004. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million\npopulation. A total of 1,444,920 new cancer cases and 559,650 deaths for cancers are pro-\njected to occur in the United States in 2007. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality\nrates include stabilization of the age-standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates for all can-\ncers combined in men from 1995 through 2003; a continuing increase in the incidence rate by\n0.3% per year in women; and a 13.6% total decrease in age-standardized cancer death rates\namong men and women combined between 1991 and 2004. This report also examines cancer\nincidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year,\nas well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. While the absolute\nnumber of cancer deaths decreased for the second consecutive year in the United States (by\nmore than 3,000 from 2003 to 2004) and much progress has been made in reducing mortality\nrates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in per-\nsons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries\nand by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.

Currently, one in\nfour deaths in the United States is due to cancer. In this article, we provide an overview of cancer statistics, includ-\ning updated incidence, mortality, and survival rates, and expected number of new cancer cases and deaths in 2007.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nData Sources\nMortality data from 1930 to 2004 in the United States were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS).1 Incidence data for long-term trends (1975 to 2003), 5-year relative survival rates, and data on lifetime\nprobability of developing cancer were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) pro-\ngram of the National Cancer Institute, covering about 26% of the US population.2,3,4,5 Incidence data (1995 to 2003)\nfor projecting new cancer cases were obtained from cancer registries that participate in the SEER program or the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), through the\nNorth American Associations of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). State-speci\ufb01c incidence rates were abstracted\nDr. Jemal is Strategic Director, Cancer\nOccurrence, Department of Epidemi-\nology and Surveillance Research,\nAmerican Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.\nMs. Siegel is Manager, Surveillance\nInformation Services, Department of\nEpidemiology and Surveillance Re-\nsearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nDr. Ward is Managing Director, Sur-\nveillance Research, Department of\nEpidemiology and Surveillance Re-\nsearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nMr. Murray is Manager, Surveillance\nData Systems, Department of Epidem-\niology and Surveillance Research,\nAmerican Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.\nMr. Xu is Analyst, Mortality Statistics\nBranch, Division of Vital Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention, Hyattsville, MD.\nDr. Thun is Vice President, Depart-\nment of Epidemiology and Surveillance\nResearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nThis article is available online at\nhttp://CAonline.AmCancerSoc.org\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nfrom Cancer in North America (1999\u20132003) Volume\nOne,6 based on data collected by cancer reg-\nistries participating in the SEER program and\nNPCR. Population data were obtained from the\nUS Census Bureau.7 Causes of death were coded\nand classified according to the International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD-8, ICD-9, and\nICD-10).8,9,10 Cancer cases were classi\ufb01ed accord-\ning to the International Classification of Diseases\nfor Oncology.11\nEstimated New Cancer Cases\nThe precise number of cancer cases diagnosed\neach year in the nation and in every state is un-\nknown because complete cancer registration has\nnot yet been achieved in some states. Since the\nAmerican Cancer Society (ACS) began produc-\ning estimates of new cancer cases in the current\nyear, the method has been re\ufb01ned several times\nto take advantage of improvements in data and\nstatistical methods. Beginning with 2007, we\nare using a new projection method described by\nPickle et al12 in an accompanying article in\nthis issue of CA. The new method is a spatio-\ntemporal model based on incidence data from\n1995 through 2003 from 41 states that met\nNAACCR\u2019s high-quality data standard for inci-\ndence, covering about 86% of the US popula-\ntion. This contrasts with the previous quadratic\nautoregressive model based on incidence data\nfrom the nine oldest SEER registries, covering\nabout 10% of the US population. Furthermore,\nthe new method considers geographic varia-\ntions in socio-demographic and lifestyle fac-\ntors, medical settings, and cancer screening\nbehaviors as predictors of incidence, and accounts\nfor expected delays in case reporting.\nEstimated Cancer Deaths\nWe used the state-space prediction method13\nto estimate the number of cancer deaths expected\nto occur in the United States and in each state\nin the year 2007. Projections are based on under-\nlying cause-of-death from death certificates as\nreported to the NCHS.1 This model projects\nthe number of cancer deaths expected to occur\nin 2007 based on the number that occurred each\nyear from 1969 to 2004 in the United States and\nin each state separately.\nOther Statistics\nWe provide mortality statistics for the lead-\ning causes of death as well as deaths from cancer\nin the year 2004. Causes of death for 2004 were\ncoded and classi\ufb01ed according to ICD-10.8 This\nreport also provides updated statistics on trends\nin cancer incidence and mortality rates, the prob-\nability of developing cancer, and 5-year relative\nsurvival rates for selected cancer sites based on data\nfrom 1975 through 2003.3 All age-adjusted inci-\ndence and death rates are standardized to the\n2000 US standard population and expressed per\n100,000 population.\nThe long-term incidence rates and trends\n(1975 to 2003) are adjusted for delays in report-\ning where possible. Delayed reporting affects the\nmost recent 1 to 3 years of incidence data (in\nthis case, 2001 to 2003), especially for cancers\nsuch as melanoma and prostate that are frequently\ndiagnosed in outpatient settings. The National\nCancer Institute (NCI) has developed a method\nto account for expected reporting delays in SEER\nregistries for all cancer sites combined and sev-\neral speci\ufb01c cancer sites when long-term inci-\ndence trends are analyzed.14 Delay-adjusted trends\nprovide a more accurate assessment of trends in\nthe most recent years for which data are available.\nSELECTED FINDINGS \nExpected Numbers of New Cancer Cases \nTable 1 presents estimated numbers of new\ncases of invasive cancer expected among men\nand women in the United States in 2007. The\noverall estimate of about 1.44 million new cases\ndoes not include carcinoma in situ of any site\nexcept urinary bladder, nor does it include basal\ncell and squamous cell cancers of the skin. More\nthan 1 million additional cases of basal cell and\nsquamous cell skin cancer, about 62,030 cases\nof breast carcinoma in situ, and 48,290 cases of\nin situ melanoma are expected to be newly diag-\nnosed in 2007. Because of the introduction of\na new projection method, estimates have been\naffected for many individual cancer sites, par-\nticularly for leukemia, female breast, lung, and\nprostate cancers. The estimated numbers of new\ncancer cases for each state and selected cancer\nsites are shown in Table 2.\nCancer Statistics, 2007\n44\nCA A Cancer Journal for Clinicians\n 15424863, 2007, 1, Downloaded from https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.57.1.43, Wiley Online Library on [06/02/2026].

It is estimated\nthat about 559,650 Americans will die from can-\ncer, corresponding to over 1,500 deaths per day.\nCancers of the lung and bronchus, prostate, and\ncolon and rectum in men, and cancers of the lung\nand bronchus, breast, and colon and rectum in\nwomen continue to be the most common fatal\ncancers. These four cancers account for half of\nthe total cancer deaths among men and women\n(Figure 1). Lung cancer surpassed breast cancer\nas the leading cause of cancer death in women in\n1987. Lung cancer is expected to account for 26%\nof all female cancer deaths in 2007. Table 3 pro-\nvides the estimated number of cancer deaths in\n2007 by state for selected cancer sites.\nRegional Variations in Cancer Rates\nTable 4 depicts cancer incidence for select\ncancers by state. Rates vary widely across states.\nFor example, among the cancers listed in Table\n4, the largest variations in the incidence rates,\nin proportionate terms, occurred in lung can-\ncer, in which rates (cases per 100,000 popula-\ntion) ranged from 41.8 in men and 21.5 in\nwomen in Utah to 137.9 in men and 73.5 in\nwomen in Kentucky. In contrast, the variation\nin female breast cancer incidence rates was small,\nranging from 115 cases per 100,000 population\nin New Mexico to 146.7 cases in Washington.\nFactors that contribute to the state variations in\nthe incidence rates include differences in the\nprevalence of risk factors, access to and utiliza-\ntion of early detection services, and complete-\nness of reporting. For example, the state variation\nin lung cancer incidence rates primarily re\ufb02ects\ndifferences in smoking prevalence; Utah ranks\nlowest in adult smoking prevalence and Kentucky\nhighest.\nTrends in Cancer Incidence and Mortality\nFigures 2 to 5 depict long-term trends in\ncancer incidence and death rates for all cancers\ncombined and for selected cancer sites by sex.\nTable 5 shows incidence and mortality patterns\nfor all cancer sites combined and for the four\nmost common cancer sites based on joinpoint\nanalysis. Trends in incidence were adjusted for\ndelayed reporting. Delay-adjusted cancer inci-\ndence rates for all sites combined stabilized in\nmen from 1995 to 2003 and increased in women\nby 0.3% per year from 1987 to 2003. \nLung cancer incidence rates are declining in\nmen and appear to be plateauing in women after\nincreasing for many decades. The lag in the tem-\nporal trend of lung cancer incidence rates in\nwomen compared with men reflects historical\ndifferences in cigarette smoking between men\nand women; cigarette smoking in women peaked\nabout 20 years later than in men. Colorectal can-\ncer incidence rates have decreased from 1998\nthrough 2003 in both males and in females. Female\nbreast cancer incidence rates leveled off from\n2001 to 2003 after increasing since 1980, which\nmay re\ufb02ect the saturation of mammography uti-\nlization and reduction in the use of hormone\nreplacement therapy.15 Prostate cancer incidence\nrates continued to increase, although at a slower\nrate than those reported for the early 1990s and\nbefore. The continuing increase for prostate can-\ncer may be attributable to increased screening\nthrough prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen (PSA) testing.15\nDeath rates for all cancer sites combined\ndecreased by 1.6% per year from 1993 to 2003\nin males and by 0.8% per year in females from\n1992 to 2003. Mortality rates have continued\nto decrease across all four major cancer sites in\nmen and in women, except for female lung can-\ncer in which rates continued to increase by 0.3%\nper year from 1995 to 2003 (Table 5).\nTable 6 shows the contribution of individual\ncancer sites to the total decrease in overall can-\ncer death rates. Death rates from all cancers com-\nbined peaked in 1990 for men and in 1991 for\nwomen. Between 1990/1991 and 2003, death\nrates from cancer decreased by 16.3% among men\nand by 8.5% among women. Among men, reduc-\ntion in death rates from lung, prostate, and colorec-\ntal cancers accounts for about 80% of the decrease\nin cancer death rates, while reduction in death\nrates from breast and colorectal cancers accounts\nfor over 60% of the decrease among women. Lung\ncancer in men and breast cancer in women alone\naccount for nearly 40% of the sex-speci\ufb01c decreases\nin cancer death rates. The decrease in lung can-\ncer death rates among men is due to reduction\nin tobacco use over the past 40 years, while the\ndecrease in death rates from female breast, col-\norectal, and prostate cancer largely re\ufb02ects improve-\nments in early detection and treatment.

African\nAmerican women have a 9% lower incidence rate,\nbut an 18% higher death rate than White women\nfor all cancer sites combined. For the speci\ufb01c can-\ncer sites listed in Table 11, incidence and death\nrates are consistently higher in African Americans\nthan in Whites, except for breast cancer (inci-\ndence) and lung and kidney cancers (incidence\nand mortality) among women. Death rates from\nprostate, stomach, and cervical cancers among\nAfrican Americans are more than twice those in\nWhites. Factors known to contribute to racial\ndisparities in mortality vary by cancer site. These\nfactors include differences in exposure to under-\nlying risk factors (eg, Helicobacter pylori for stom-\nach cancer), access to high-quality regular screening\n(breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers), and timely\ndiagnosis and treatment (for many cancers). The\nhigher breast cancer incidence rates among Whites\nare thought to re\ufb02ect a combination of factors\nthat affect diagnosis (such as more frequent mam-\nmography in White women until the most recent\ntime period) and those that affect disease risk\n(such as later age at \ufb01rst birth and greater use of\nhormone replacement therapy among White than\nAfrican American women).16\nAmong other racial and ethnic groups, can-\ncer incidence and death rates are lower than\n53\nVolume 57 \u2022 Number 1 \u2022 January/February 2007\nCA Cancer J Clin 2007;57:43\u201366\nFIGURE 4\nAnnual Age-adjusted Cancer Death Rates* Among Males for Selected Cancers, US, 1930 to 2003.\n*Rates are age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.

However, the incidence and\ndeath rates are generally higher in minority pop-\nulations than in Whites for cancers of the uter-\nine cervix, stomach, and liver. Stomach and liver\ncancer incidence and death rates are more than\ntwice as high in Asian American/Paci\ufb01c Islanders\nas in Whites, reflecting increased exposure to\ninfectious agents such as Helicobacter pylori and\nhepatitis B.17 Kidney cancer incidence and death\nrates are the highest among American Indians/\nAlaskan Natives, although factors that contribute\nto this are unknown.\nTrends in cancer incidence can only be\nadjusted for delayed reporting in Whites and\nAfrican Americans, and not in other racial and\nethnic subgroups, because long-term incidence\ndata required for delay adjustment are available\nonly for Whites and African Americans. From\n1995 to 2003, sex-specific incidence rates for\nall cancer sites combined, not adjusted for delayed\nreporting, have stabilized, except for African\nAmerican and Hispanic men, in whom rates\ndecreased by 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively.

However, because of the relatively\nearly age of breast cancer onset, women have a\nslightly higher probability of developing cancer\nbefore age 60 years. It is noteworthy that these esti-\nmates are based on the average experience of the\ngeneral population and may over- or underesti-\nmate individual risk because of differences in\nexposure and/or genetic susceptibility.\nCancer Survival by Race\nCompared with Whites, African American\nmen and women have poorer survival once a\ncancer diagnosis is made. As shown in Figure 7,\nAfrican Americans are less likely than Whites to\nbe diagnosed with cancer at a localized stage,\nwhen the disease may be more easily and suc-\ncessfully treated, and are more likely to be diag-\nnosed with cancer at a regional or distant stage of\ndisease. Five-year relative survival is lower in\nAfrican Americans than Whites within each stra-\ntum of stage of diagnosis for nearly every cancer\nsite (Figure 8). These disparities may result from\ninequalities in access to and receipt of quality\nhealth care and/or within-stage differences in\ntumor characteristics. The contribution of  these\nfactors, individually or collectively, to the differ-\nential survival for specific cancers is unclear.18\nHowever, some studies suggest that African\n55\nVolume 57 \u2022 Number 1 \u2022 January/February 2007\nCA Cancer J Clin 2007;57:43\u201366\nLine Segment 1\nLine Segment 2\nLine Segment 3\nLine Segment 4\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nAll sites\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1983\n0.9 \u2020\n1983-1992\n1.8 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-1.5\n1995-2003\n0.1\nMale\n1975-1989\n1.3 \u2020\n1989-1992\n5.1 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-4.5 \u2020\n1995-2003\n0.0\nFemale\n1975-1979\n-0.3\n1979-1987\n1.6 \u2020\n1987-2003\n0.3 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1990\n0.5 \u2020\n1990-1994\n-0.4\n1994-2003\n-1.1 \u2020\nMale  \n1975-1979\n1.0 \u2020\n1979-1990\n0.3 \u2020\n1990-1993\n-0.4\n1993-2003\n-1.6 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1992\n0.5 \u2020\n1992-2003\n-0.8 \u2020\nLung & bronchus\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1982\n2.5 \u2020\n1982-1991\n0.9 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-0.7 \u2020\nMale   \n1975-1982\n1.5 \u2020\n1982-1991\n-0.5 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-1.7 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1982\n5.6 \u2020\n1982-1991\n3.4 \u2020\n1991-2003\n0.5 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1980\n3.0 \u2020\n1980-1990\n1.8 \u2020\n1990-1994\n-0.1\n1994-2003\n-0.9 \u2020\nMale  \n1975-1978\n2.4 \u2020\n1978-1984\n1.2 \u2020\n1984-1991\n0.3 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1982\n6.0 \u2020\n1982-1990\n4.2 \u2020\n1990-1995\n1.7 \u2020\n1995-2003\n0.3 \u2020\nColon & rectum\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1985\n0.8 \u2020\n1985-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.2\n1998-2003\n-2.1 \u2020\nMale    \n1975-1986\n1.1 \u2020\n1986-1995\n-2.1 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.0\n1998-2003\n-2.5 \u2020\nFemale  \n1975-1985\n0.3\n1985-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.7\n1998-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1978\n0.2\n1978-1985\n-0.8 \u2020\n1985-2001\n-1.8 \u2020\n2001-2003\n-2.8 \u2020\nMale   \n1975-1978\n0.8\n1978-1984\n-0.4\n1984-1990\n-1.3 \u2020\n1990-2003\n-2.1 \u2020\nFemale  \n1975-1984\n-1.0 \u2020\n1984-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nBreast (female)\nIncidence\n1975-1980\n-0.4\n1980-1987\n3.7 \u2020\n1987-2001\n0.5 \u2020\n2001-2003\n-4.1\nDeath\n1975-1990\n0.4 \u2020\n1990-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1999\n-3.1 \u2020\n1999-2003\n-1.4 \u2020\nProstate\nIncidence\n1975-1988\n2.6 \u2020\n1988-1992\n16.4 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-10.8 \u2020\n1995-2003\n1.1 \u2020\nDeath\n1975-1987\n0.9 \u2020\n1987-1991\n3.1 \u2020\n1991-1994\n-0.6\n1994-2003\n-4.0 \u2020\n*Annual percent change based on incidence (delay-adjusted) and mortality rates age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.\n\u2020The APC is significantly different from zero.\nNote: Trends were analyzed by Joinpoint Regression Program, version 3.1, with a maximum of three joinpoints (ie, four line segments).\nTABLE 5\nTrends in Cancer Incidence and Death Rates for Selected Cancers by Sex, US, 1975 to 2003\nSource: Ries LAG, Harkins D, Krapcho M, et al., eds.

This is true for both Whites and African\nAmericans. Cancers for which survival has not\nimproved substantially over the past 25 years\ninclude uterine corpus, cervix, larynx, lung,\nand pancreas.\nRelative survival rates cannot be calculated\nfor other racial and ethnic populations because\naccurate life expectancies (the average number\nof years of life remaining for persons who have\nattained a given age) are not available. However,\nbased on cause-speci\ufb01c survival rates of cancer\npatients diagnosed from 1992 to 2000 in SEER\nareas of the United States, all minority popula-\ntions, except Asian American/Pacific Islander\nwomen, have a greater probability of dying from\ncancer within 5 years of diagnosis than non-\nHispanic Whites, after accounting for differ-\nences in stage at diagnosis.15,20 For the four major\ncancer sites (prostate, female breast, lung and\nbronchus, and colon and rectum), minority pop-\nulations are more likely to be diagnosed at dis-\ntant stage, compared with non-Hispanic Whites.20\nCANCER IN CHILDREN\nCancer is the second leading cause of death\namong children between age 1 to 14 years in\nthe United States; accidents are the most fre-\nquent cause of death in this age group (Table\n14). The most common cancers in children (aged\n0 to 14 years) are leukemia (particularly acute\nlymphocytic leukemia), brain and other nerv-\nous system cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, non-\nHodgkin lymphoma, and renal (Wilms) tumors.3\nOver the past 25 years, there have been signi\ufb01-\ncant improvements in the 5-year relative sur-\nvival rate for many childhood cancers (Table 15).\nThe 5-year relative survival rate among children\nfor all cancer sites combined improved from 58%\nfor patients diagnosed in 1975 to 1977 to 79%\nfor those diagnosed in 1996 to 2002.3\n70 and\nBirth to\nBirth to 39\n40 to 59\n60 to 69\nOlder\nDeath\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\nAll sites\u2020\nMale\n1.42 (1 in 70)\n8.69 (1 in 12)\n16.58 (1 in 6)\n39.44 (1 in 3)\n45.31 (1 in 2)\nFemale\n2.03 (1 in 49)\n9.09 (1 in 11)\n10.57 (1 in 9)\n26.60 (1 in 4)\n37.86 (1 in 3)\nUrinary bladder\nMale\n.02 (1 in 4381)\n.41 (1 in 241)\n.96 (1 in 105)\n3.41 (1 in 29)\n3.61 (1 in 28)\nFemale\n.01 (1 in 9527)\n.13 (1 in 782)\n.26 (1 in 379)\n.96 (1 in 105)\n1.14 (1 in 87)\nBreast\nFemale\n.48 (1 in 210)\n3.98 (1 in 25)\n3.65 (1 in 27)\n6.84 (1 in 15)\n12.67 (1 in 8)\nColon & rectum\nMale\n.07 (1 in 1342)\n.93 (1 in 107)\n1.67 (1 in 60)\n4.92 (1 in 20)\n5.79 (1 in 17)\nFemale\n.07 (1 in 1469)\n.73 (1 in 138)\n1.16 (1 in 86)\n4.45 (1 in 22)\n5.37 (1 in 19)\nLeukemia\nMale\n.16 (1 in 640)\n.22 (1 in 452)\n.35 (1 in 286)\n1.17 (1 in 86)\n1.49 (1 in 67)\nFemale\n.12 (1 in 820)\n.14 (1 in 694)\n.20 (1 in 491)\n.75 (1 in 132)\n1.05 (1 in 95)\nLung & bronchus\nMale\n.03 (1 in 3146)\n1.09 (1 in 92)\n2.61 (1 in 38)\n6.76 (1 in 15)\n8.02 (1 in 12)\nFemale\n.04 (1 in 2779)\n.85 (1 in 117)\n1.84 (1 in 54)\n4.52 (1 in 22)\n6.15 (1 in 16)\nMelanoma of the skin\nMale\n.13 (1 in 775)\n.53 (1 in 187)\n.56 (1 in 178)\n1.32 (1 in 76)\n2.04 (1 in 49)\nFemale\n.21 (1 in 467)\n.42 (1 in 237)\n.29 (1 in 347)\n.62 (1 in 163)\n1.38 (1 in 73)\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nMale\n.14 (1 in 735)\n.45 (1 in 222)\n.57 (1 in 176)\n1.56 (1 in 64)\n2.14 (1 in 47)\nFemale\n.08 (1 in 1200)\n.32 (1 in 313)\n.44 (1 in 229)\n1.30 (1 in 77)\n1.83 (1 in 55)\nProstate\nMale\n.01 (1 in 10373)\n2.59 (1 in 39)\n7.03 (1 in 14)\n13.83 (1 in 7)\n17.12 (1 in 6)\nUterine cervix\nFemale\n.16 (1 in 631)\n.29 (1 in 346)\n.14 (1 in 695)\n.20 (1 in 512)\n.73 (1 in 138)\nUterine corpus\nFemale\n.06 (1 in 1652)\n.70 (1 in 142)\n.81 (1 in 124)\n1.28 (1 in 78)\n2.49 (1 in 40)\n*For those free of cancer at beginning of age interval.

These estimates may vary con-\nsiderably from year to year, particularly for less\ncommon cancers and in states with smaller pop-\nulations. Unanticipated changes may occur that\nare not captured by modeling techniques.\nEstimates are also affected by changes in method.\nThe introduction of a new method for estimat-\ning new cancer cases in 2007 has substantially\naffected the estimates for a number of cancers,\nparticularly leukemia and female breast (see Pickle\net al for more detailed discussion).12 For these\nreasons, we discourage the use of these estimates\nto track year-to-year changes in cancer occurrence\nand death. Age-standardized or age-speci\ufb01c can-\ncer death rates from the NCHS and cancer inci-\ndence rates from SEER or NPCR are the\npreferred data sources for tracking cancer trends,\neven though these data are 3 and 4 years old,\nrespectively, by the time that they become avail-\nable. Despite their limitations, the ACS estimates\nof the number of new cancer cases and deaths\nin the current year provide reasonably accurate\nestimates of the burden of new cancer cases and\ndeaths in the United States. Such estimates will\nassist in continuing efforts to reduce the public\nhealth burden of cancer.\nREFERENCES\n1.

To introduce a multidisciplinary approach for the management of COVID-19-infected \npatients and to report the first operated patient in the Corona unit.\nMethods\u2002 A detailed presentation of the hospital plan for a separate Corona unit with its intensive care unit and operating \nrooms. Description of the management of the first spine surgery case treated in this unit.\nResults\u2002 The Corona unit showed a practical approach for the management of an emergency cervical spine fracture-dislocation \nwith acute paralysis. The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the \ninternal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room. Education of the medical staff and organiza-\ntion of the operating theatre facilitated the management of the patient without an increased risk of spreading the infection.\nConclusions\u2002 The current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary organization of the medical and surgical care of \nthe patients. It is possible to manage an infected or a potentially infected patient surgically, but a multidisciplinary plan is \nnecessary to protect other patients and the medical staff.\nKeywords\u2002 COVID-19\u00a0\u00b7 Emergency\u00a0\u00b7 Cervical fracture\u00a0\u00b7 Corona ward\u00a0\u00b7 Surgical planning\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nIn late 2019, a series of severe acute respiratory syndrome \n(SARS) was reported in China. The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms. Protective masks (FFP3 filtering facepiece particle \nFig.\u202f2\u2002 \u2009A 92-year-old female patient presenting with fracture-dislocation C6-7. Sagittal CT a, facet joint dislocation on the right side b, facet \njoint dislocation on the left side c, MRI examination d and postoperative X-ray showing reduction and fixation e\u200a\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n472\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\n3), head covers and eye goggles are adequately stocked in the \noperating rooms. The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation. Surgical team (a), anaesthesia team (b) and the operating room equipment (c)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n473\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\nthe neurological status was recorded (ASIA B). On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions.

We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.

The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the \ninternal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room.

The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms. Protective masks (FFP3 filtering facepiece particle \nFig.\u202f2\u2002 \u2009A 92-year-old female patient presenting with fracture-dislocation C6-7. Sagittal CT a, facet joint dislocation on the right side b, facet \njoint dislocation on the left side c, MRI examination d and postoperative X-ray showing reduction and fixation e\u200a\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n472\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\n3), head covers and eye goggles are adequately stocked in the \noperating rooms. The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation.

On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions. Tian et\u00a0al. [17] \nrecently published their experience with telerobotic spinal \nsurgery based on 5G technology. They performed remote \nsurgery in 12 cases and concluded that this technology could \nbuild a connection between surgeons and patients located in \nisolated or rural areas with a lack of medical resources. We \ndo not have experience with this technology; however, this \nmight be an attractive option in such pandemic situations \nprovided the necessary infrastructures are available.\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n474\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nElective spine operations, is\u00a0it the\u00a0right time?\nIn the last few weeks, the number of new cases is signifi-\ncantly reduced. We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.

Thun, MD, MS\nABSTRACT\nEach year, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates the number of new\ncancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the\nmost recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from\nthe National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North\nAmerican Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center\nfor Health Statistics. This report considers incidence data through 2003 and mortality data\nthrough 2004. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million\npopulation. A total of 1,444,920 new cancer cases and 559,650 deaths for cancers are pro-\njected to occur in the United States in 2007. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality\nrates include stabilization of the age-standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates for all can-\ncers combined in men from 1995 through 2003; a continuing increase in the incidence rate by\n0.3% per year in women; and a 13.6% total decrease in age-standardized cancer death rates\namong men and women combined between 1991 and 2004. This report also examines cancer\nincidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year,\nas well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. While the absolute\nnumber of cancer deaths decreased for the second consecutive year in the United States (by\nmore than 3,000 from 2003 to 2004) and much progress has been made in reducing mortality\nrates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in per-\nsons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries\nand by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.

Currently, one in\nfour deaths in the United States is due to cancer. In this article, we provide an overview of cancer statistics, includ-\ning updated incidence, mortality, and survival rates, and expected number of new cancer cases and deaths in 2007.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nData Sources\nMortality data from 1930 to 2004 in the United States were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS).1 Incidence data for long-term trends (1975 to 2003), 5-year relative survival rates, and data on lifetime\nprobability of developing cancer were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) pro-\ngram of the National Cancer Institute, covering about 26% of the US population.2,3,4,5 Incidence data (1995 to 2003)\nfor projecting new cancer cases were obtained from cancer registries that participate in the SEER program or the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), through the\nNorth American Associations of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). State-speci\ufb01c incidence rates were abstracted\nDr. Jemal is Strategic Director, Cancer\nOccurrence, Department of Epidemi-\nology and Surveillance Research,\nAmerican Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.\nMs. Siegel is Manager, Surveillance\nInformation Services, Department of\nEpidemiology and Surveillance Re-\nsearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nDr. Ward is Managing Director, Sur-\nveillance Research, Department of\nEpidemiology and Surveillance Re-\nsearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nMr. Murray is Manager, Surveillance\nData Systems, Department of Epidem-\niology and Surveillance Research,\nAmerican Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.\nMr. Xu is Analyst, Mortality Statistics\nBranch, Division of Vital Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention, Hyattsville, MD.\nDr. Thun is Vice President, Depart-\nment of Epidemiology and Surveillance\nResearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nThis article is available online at\nhttp://CAonline.AmCancerSoc.org\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nfrom Cancer in North America (1999\u20132003) Volume\nOne,6 based on data collected by cancer reg-\nistries participating in the SEER program and\nNPCR. Population data were obtained from the\nUS Census Bureau.7 Causes of death were coded\nand classified according to the International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD-8, ICD-9, and\nICD-10).8,9,10 Cancer cases were classi\ufb01ed accord-\ning to the International Classification of Diseases\nfor Oncology.11\nEstimated New Cancer Cases\nThe precise number of cancer cases diagnosed\neach year in the nation and in every state is un-\nknown because complete cancer registration has\nnot yet been achieved in some states. Since the\nAmerican Cancer Society (ACS) began produc-\ning estimates of new cancer cases in the current\nyear, the method has been re\ufb01ned several times\nto take advantage of improvements in data and\nstatistical methods. Beginning with 2007, we\nare using a new projection method described by\nPickle et al12 in an accompanying article in\nthis issue of CA. The new method is a spatio-\ntemporal model based on incidence data from\n1995 through 2003 from 41 states that met\nNAACCR\u2019s high-quality data standard for inci-\ndence, covering about 86% of the US popula-\ntion. This contrasts with the previous quadratic\nautoregressive model based on incidence data\nfrom the nine oldest SEER registries, covering\nabout 10% of the US population. Furthermore,\nthe new method considers geographic varia-\ntions in socio-demographic and lifestyle fac-\ntors, medical settings, and cancer screening\nbehaviors as predictors of incidence, and accounts\nfor expected delays in case reporting.\nEstimated Cancer Deaths\nWe used the state-space prediction method13\nto estimate the number of cancer deaths expected\nto occur in the United States and in each state\nin the year 2007. Projections are based on under-\nlying cause-of-death from death certificates as\nreported to the NCHS.1 This model projects\nthe number of cancer deaths expected to occur\nin 2007 based on the number that occurred each\nyear from 1969 to 2004 in the United States and\nin each state separately.\nOther Statistics\nWe provide mortality statistics for the lead-\ning causes of death as well as deaths from cancer\nin the year 2004. Causes of death for 2004 were\ncoded and classi\ufb01ed according to ICD-10.8 This\nreport also provides updated statistics on trends\nin cancer incidence and mortality rates, the prob-\nability of developing cancer, and 5-year relative\nsurvival rates for selected cancer sites based on data\nfrom 1975 through 2003.3 All age-adjusted inci-\ndence and death rates are standardized to the\n2000 US standard population and expressed per\n100,000 population.\nThe long-term incidence rates and trends\n(1975 to 2003) are adjusted for delays in report-\ning where possible. Delayed reporting affects the\nmost recent 1 to 3 years of incidence data (in\nthis case, 2001 to 2003), especially for cancers\nsuch as melanoma and prostate that are frequently\ndiagnosed in outpatient settings. The National\nCancer Institute (NCI) has developed a method\nto account for expected reporting delays in SEER\nregistries for all cancer sites combined and sev-\neral speci\ufb01c cancer sites when long-term inci-\ndence trends are analyzed.14 Delay-adjusted trends\nprovide a more accurate assessment of trends in\nthe most recent years for which data are available.\nSELECTED FINDINGS \nExpected Numbers of New Cancer Cases \nTable 1 presents estimated numbers of new\ncases of invasive cancer expected among men\nand women in the United States in 2007. The\noverall estimate of about 1.44 million new cases\ndoes not include carcinoma in situ of any site\nexcept urinary bladder, nor does it include basal\ncell and squamous cell cancers of the skin. More\nthan 1 million additional cases of basal cell and\nsquamous cell skin cancer, about 62,030 cases\nof breast carcinoma in situ, and 48,290 cases of\nin situ melanoma are expected to be newly diag-\nnosed in 2007. Because of the introduction of\na new projection method, estimates have been\naffected for many individual cancer sites, par-\nticularly for leukemia, female breast, lung, and\nprostate cancers. The estimated numbers of new\ncancer cases for each state and selected cancer\nsites are shown in Table 2.\nCancer Statistics, 2007\n44\nCA A Cancer Journal for Clinicians\n 15424863, 2007, 1, Downloaded from https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.57.1.43, Wiley Online Library on [06/02/2026].

It is estimated\nthat about 559,650 Americans will die from can-\ncer, corresponding to over 1,500 deaths per day.\nCancers of the lung and bronchus, prostate, and\ncolon and rectum in men, and cancers of the lung\nand bronchus, breast, and colon and rectum in\nwomen continue to be the most common fatal\ncancers. These four cancers account for half of\nthe total cancer deaths among men and women\n(Figure 1). Lung cancer surpassed breast cancer\nas the leading cause of cancer death in women in\n1987. Lung cancer is expected to account for 26%\nof all female cancer deaths in 2007. Table 3 pro-\nvides the estimated number of cancer deaths in\n2007 by state for selected cancer sites.\nRegional Variations in Cancer Rates\nTable 4 depicts cancer incidence for select\ncancers by state. Rates vary widely across states.\nFor example, among the cancers listed in Table\n4, the largest variations in the incidence rates,\nin proportionate terms, occurred in lung can-\ncer, in which rates (cases per 100,000 popula-\ntion) ranged from 41.8 in men and 21.5 in\nwomen in Utah to 137.9 in men and 73.5 in\nwomen in Kentucky. In contrast, the variation\nin female breast cancer incidence rates was small,\nranging from 115 cases per 100,000 population\nin New Mexico to 146.7 cases in Washington.\nFactors that contribute to the state variations in\nthe incidence rates include differences in the\nprevalence of risk factors, access to and utiliza-\ntion of early detection services, and complete-\nness of reporting. For example, the state variation\nin lung cancer incidence rates primarily re\ufb02ects\ndifferences in smoking prevalence; Utah ranks\nlowest in adult smoking prevalence and Kentucky\nhighest.\nTrends in Cancer Incidence and Mortality\nFigures 2 to 5 depict long-term trends in\ncancer incidence and death rates for all cancers\ncombined and for selected cancer sites by sex.\nTable 5 shows incidence and mortality patterns\nfor all cancer sites combined and for the four\nmost common cancer sites based on joinpoint\nanalysis. Trends in incidence were adjusted for\ndelayed reporting. Delay-adjusted cancer inci-\ndence rates for all sites combined stabilized in\nmen from 1995 to 2003 and increased in women\nby 0.3% per year from 1987 to 2003. \nLung cancer incidence rates are declining in\nmen and appear to be plateauing in women after\nincreasing for many decades. The lag in the tem-\nporal trend of lung cancer incidence rates in\nwomen compared with men reflects historical\ndifferences in cigarette smoking between men\nand women; cigarette smoking in women peaked\nabout 20 years later than in men. Colorectal can-\ncer incidence rates have decreased from 1998\nthrough 2003 in both males and in females. Female\nbreast cancer incidence rates leveled off from\n2001 to 2003 after increasing since 1980, which\nmay re\ufb02ect the saturation of mammography uti-\nlization and reduction in the use of hormone\nreplacement therapy.15 Prostate cancer incidence\nrates continued to increase, although at a slower\nrate than those reported for the early 1990s and\nbefore. The continuing increase for prostate can-\ncer may be attributable to increased screening\nthrough prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen (PSA) testing.15\nDeath rates for all cancer sites combined\ndecreased by 1.6% per year from 1993 to 2003\nin males and by 0.8% per year in females from\n1992 to 2003. Mortality rates have continued\nto decrease across all four major cancer sites in\nmen and in women, except for female lung can-\ncer in which rates continued to increase by 0.3%\nper year from 1995 to 2003 (Table 5).\nTable 6 shows the contribution of individual\ncancer sites to the total decrease in overall can-\ncer death rates. Death rates from all cancers com-\nbined peaked in 1990 for men and in 1991 for\nwomen. Between 1990/1991 and 2003, death\nrates from cancer decreased by 16.3% among men\nand by 8.5% among women. Among men, reduc-\ntion in death rates from lung, prostate, and colorec-\ntal cancers accounts for about 80% of the decrease\nin cancer death rates, while reduction in death\nrates from breast and colorectal cancers accounts\nfor over 60% of the decrease among women. Lung\ncancer in men and breast cancer in women alone\naccount for nearly 40% of the sex-speci\ufb01c decreases\nin cancer death rates. The decrease in lung can-\ncer death rates among men is due to reduction\nin tobacco use over the past 40 years, while the\ndecrease in death rates from female breast, col-\norectal, and prostate cancer largely re\ufb02ects improve-\nments in early detection and treatment.

Cancer\nis the leading cause of death among women\naged 40 to 79 years and among men aged 60 to\n79 years. When age-adjusted death rates are\nconsidered (Figure 6), cancer is the leading\ncause of death among men and women under\nage 85 years.

African\nAmerican women have a 9% lower incidence rate,\nbut an 18% higher death rate than White women\nfor all cancer sites combined. For the speci\ufb01c can-\ncer sites listed in Table 11, incidence and death\nrates are consistently higher in African Americans\nthan in Whites, except for breast cancer (inci-\ndence) and lung and kidney cancers (incidence\nand mortality) among women. Death rates from\nprostate, stomach, and cervical cancers among\nAfrican Americans are more than twice those in\nWhites. Factors known to contribute to racial\ndisparities in mortality vary by cancer site. These\nfactors include differences in exposure to under-\nlying risk factors (eg, Helicobacter pylori for stom-\nach cancer), access to high-quality regular screening\n(breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers), and timely\ndiagnosis and treatment (for many cancers). The\nhigher breast cancer incidence rates among Whites\nare thought to re\ufb02ect a combination of factors\nthat affect diagnosis (such as more frequent mam-\nmography in White women until the most recent\ntime period) and those that affect disease risk\n(such as later age at \ufb01rst birth and greater use of\nhormone replacement therapy among White than\nAfrican American women).16\nAmong other racial and ethnic groups, can-\ncer incidence and death rates are lower than\n53\nVolume 57 \u2022 Number 1 \u2022 January/February 2007\nCA Cancer J Clin 2007;57:43\u201366\nFIGURE 4\nAnnual Age-adjusted Cancer Death Rates* Among Males for Selected Cancers, US, 1930 to 2003.\n*Rates are age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.

However, the incidence and\ndeath rates are generally higher in minority pop-\nulations than in Whites for cancers of the uter-\nine cervix, stomach, and liver. Stomach and liver\ncancer incidence and death rates are more than\ntwice as high in Asian American/Paci\ufb01c Islanders\nas in Whites, reflecting increased exposure to\ninfectious agents such as Helicobacter pylori and\nhepatitis B.17 Kidney cancer incidence and death\nrates are the highest among American Indians/\nAlaskan Natives, although factors that contribute\nto this are unknown.\nTrends in cancer incidence can only be\nadjusted for delayed reporting in Whites and\nAfrican Americans, and not in other racial and\nethnic subgroups, because long-term incidence\ndata required for delay adjustment are available\nonly for Whites and African Americans. From\n1995 to 2003, sex-specific incidence rates for\nall cancer sites combined, not adjusted for delayed\nreporting, have stabilized, except for African\nAmerican and Hispanic men, in whom rates\ndecreased by 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively.

However, because of the relatively\nearly age of breast cancer onset, women have a\nslightly higher probability of developing cancer\nbefore age 60 years. It is noteworthy that these esti-\nmates are based on the average experience of the\ngeneral population and may over- or underesti-\nmate individual risk because of differences in\nexposure and/or genetic susceptibility.\nCancer Survival by Race\nCompared with Whites, African American\nmen and women have poorer survival once a\ncancer diagnosis is made. As shown in Figure 7,\nAfrican Americans are less likely than Whites to\nbe diagnosed with cancer at a localized stage,\nwhen the disease may be more easily and suc-\ncessfully treated, and are more likely to be diag-\nnosed with cancer at a regional or distant stage of\ndisease. Five-year relative survival is lower in\nAfrican Americans than Whites within each stra-\ntum of stage of diagnosis for nearly every cancer\nsite (Figure 8). These disparities may result from\ninequalities in access to and receipt of quality\nhealth care and/or within-stage differences in\ntumor characteristics. The contribution of  these\nfactors, individually or collectively, to the differ-\nential survival for specific cancers is unclear.18\nHowever, some studies suggest that African\n55\nVolume 57 \u2022 Number 1 \u2022 January/February 2007\nCA Cancer J Clin 2007;57:43\u201366\nLine Segment 1\nLine Segment 2\nLine Segment 3\nLine Segment 4\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nAll sites\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1983\n0.9 \u2020\n1983-1992\n1.8 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-1.5\n1995-2003\n0.1\nMale\n1975-1989\n1.3 \u2020\n1989-1992\n5.1 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-4.5 \u2020\n1995-2003\n0.0\nFemale\n1975-1979\n-0.3\n1979-1987\n1.6 \u2020\n1987-2003\n0.3 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1990\n0.5 \u2020\n1990-1994\n-0.4\n1994-2003\n-1.1 \u2020\nMale  \n1975-1979\n1.0 \u2020\n1979-1990\n0.3 \u2020\n1990-1993\n-0.4\n1993-2003\n-1.6 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1992\n0.5 \u2020\n1992-2003\n-0.8 \u2020\nLung & bronchus\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1982\n2.5 \u2020\n1982-1991\n0.9 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-0.7 \u2020\nMale   \n1975-1982\n1.5 \u2020\n1982-1991\n-0.5 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-1.7 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1982\n5.6 \u2020\n1982-1991\n3.4 \u2020\n1991-2003\n0.5 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1980\n3.0 \u2020\n1980-1990\n1.8 \u2020\n1990-1994\n-0.1\n1994-2003\n-0.9 \u2020\nMale  \n1975-1978\n2.4 \u2020\n1978-1984\n1.2 \u2020\n1984-1991\n0.3 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1982\n6.0 \u2020\n1982-1990\n4.2 \u2020\n1990-1995\n1.7 \u2020\n1995-2003\n0.3 \u2020\nColon & rectum\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1985\n0.8 \u2020\n1985-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.2\n1998-2003\n-2.1 \u2020\nMale    \n1975-1986\n1.1 \u2020\n1986-1995\n-2.1 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.0\n1998-2003\n-2.5 \u2020\nFemale  \n1975-1985\n0.3\n1985-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.7\n1998-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1978\n0.2\n1978-1985\n-0.8 \u2020\n1985-2001\n-1.8 \u2020\n2001-2003\n-2.8 \u2020\nMale   \n1975-1978\n0.8\n1978-1984\n-0.4\n1984-1990\n-1.3 \u2020\n1990-2003\n-2.1 \u2020\nFemale  \n1975-1984\n-1.0 \u2020\n1984-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nBreast (female)\nIncidence\n1975-1980\n-0.4\n1980-1987\n3.7 \u2020\n1987-2001\n0.5 \u2020\n2001-2003\n-4.1\nDeath\n1975-1990\n0.4 \u2020\n1990-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1999\n-3.1 \u2020\n1999-2003\n-1.4 \u2020\nProstate\nIncidence\n1975-1988\n2.6 \u2020\n1988-1992\n16.4 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-10.8 \u2020\n1995-2003\n1.1 \u2020\nDeath\n1975-1987\n0.9 \u2020\n1987-1991\n3.1 \u2020\n1991-1994\n-0.6\n1994-2003\n-4.0 \u2020\n*Annual percent change based on incidence (delay-adjusted) and mortality rates age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.\n\u2020The APC is significantly different from zero.\nNote: Trends were analyzed by Joinpoint Regression Program, version 3.1, with a maximum of three joinpoints (ie, four line segments).\nTABLE 5\nTrends in Cancer Incidence and Death Rates for Selected Cancers by Sex, US, 1975 to 2003\nSource: Ries LAG, Harkins D, Krapcho M, et al., eds.

This is true for both Whites and African\nAmericans. Cancers for which survival has not\nimproved substantially over the past 25 years\ninclude uterine corpus, cervix, larynx, lung,\nand pancreas.\nRelative survival rates cannot be calculated\nfor other racial and ethnic populations because\naccurate life expectancies (the average number\nof years of life remaining for persons who have\nattained a given age) are not available. However,\nbased on cause-speci\ufb01c survival rates of cancer\npatients diagnosed from 1992 to 2000 in SEER\nareas of the United States, all minority popula-\ntions, except Asian American/Pacific Islander\nwomen, have a greater probability of dying from\ncancer within 5 years of diagnosis than non-\nHispanic Whites, after accounting for differ-\nences in stage at diagnosis.15,20 For the four major\ncancer sites (prostate, female breast, lung and\nbronchus, and colon and rectum), minority pop-\nulations are more likely to be diagnosed at dis-\ntant stage, compared with non-Hispanic Whites.20\nCANCER IN CHILDREN\nCancer is the second leading cause of death\namong children between age 1 to 14 years in\nthe United States; accidents are the most fre-\nquent cause of death in this age group (Table\n14). The most common cancers in children (aged\n0 to 14 years) are leukemia (particularly acute\nlymphocytic leukemia), brain and other nerv-\nous system cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, non-\nHodgkin lymphoma, and renal (Wilms) tumors.3\nOver the past 25 years, there have been signi\ufb01-\ncant improvements in the 5-year relative sur-\nvival rate for many childhood cancers (Table 15).\nThe 5-year relative survival rate among children\nfor all cancer sites combined improved from 58%\nfor patients diagnosed in 1975 to 1977 to 79%\nfor those diagnosed in 1996 to 2002.3\n70 and\nBirth to\nBirth to 39\n40 to 59\n60 to 69\nOlder\nDeath\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\nAll sites\u2020\nMale\n1.42 (1 in 70)\n8.69 (1 in 12)\n16.58 (1 in 6)\n39.44 (1 in 3)\n45.31 (1 in 2)\nFemale\n2.03 (1 in 49)\n9.09 (1 in 11)\n10.57 (1 in 9)\n26.60 (1 in 4)\n37.86 (1 in 3)\nUrinary bladder\nMale\n.02 (1 in 4381)\n.41 (1 in 241)\n.96 (1 in 105)\n3.41 (1 in 29)\n3.61 (1 in 28)\nFemale\n.01 (1 in 9527)\n.13 (1 in 782)\n.26 (1 in 379)\n.96 (1 in 105)\n1.14 (1 in 87)\nBreast\nFemale\n.48 (1 in 210)\n3.98 (1 in 25)\n3.65 (1 in 27)\n6.84 (1 in 15)\n12.67 (1 in 8)\nColon & rectum\nMale\n.07 (1 in 1342)\n.93 (1 in 107)\n1.67 (1 in 60)\n4.92 (1 in 20)\n5.79 (1 in 17)\nFemale\n.07 (1 in 1469)\n.73 (1 in 138)\n1.16 (1 in 86)\n4.45 (1 in 22)\n5.37 (1 in 19)\nLeukemia\nMale\n.16 (1 in 640)\n.22 (1 in 452)\n.35 (1 in 286)\n1.17 (1 in 86)\n1.49 (1 in 67)\nFemale\n.12 (1 in 820)\n.14 (1 in 694)\n.20 (1 in 491)\n.75 (1 in 132)\n1.05 (1 in 95)\nLung & bronchus\nMale\n.03 (1 in 3146)\n1.09 (1 in 92)\n2.61 (1 in 38)\n6.76 (1 in 15)\n8.02 (1 in 12)\nFemale\n.04 (1 in 2779)\n.85 (1 in 117)\n1.84 (1 in 54)\n4.52 (1 in 22)\n6.15 (1 in 16)\nMelanoma of the skin\nMale\n.13 (1 in 775)\n.53 (1 in 187)\n.56 (1 in 178)\n1.32 (1 in 76)\n2.04 (1 in 49)\nFemale\n.21 (1 in 467)\n.42 (1 in 237)\n.29 (1 in 347)\n.62 (1 in 163)\n1.38 (1 in 73)\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nMale\n.14 (1 in 735)\n.45 (1 in 222)\n.57 (1 in 176)\n1.56 (1 in 64)\n2.14 (1 in 47)\nFemale\n.08 (1 in 1200)\n.32 (1 in 313)\n.44 (1 in 229)\n1.30 (1 in 77)\n1.83 (1 in 55)\nProstate\nMale\n.01 (1 in 10373)\n2.59 (1 in 39)\n7.03 (1 in 14)\n13.83 (1 in 7)\n17.12 (1 in 6)\nUterine cervix\nFemale\n.16 (1 in 631)\n.29 (1 in 346)\n.14 (1 in 695)\n.20 (1 in 512)\n.73 (1 in 138)\nUterine corpus\nFemale\n.06 (1 in 1652)\n.70 (1 in 142)\n.81 (1 in 124)\n1.28 (1 in 78)\n2.49 (1 in 40)\n*For those free of cancer at beginning of age interval.

These estimates may vary con-\nsiderably from year to year, particularly for less\ncommon cancers and in states with smaller pop-\nulations. Unanticipated changes may occur that\nare not captured by modeling techniques.\nEstimates are also affected by changes in method.\nThe introduction of a new method for estimat-\ning new cancer cases in 2007 has substantially\naffected the estimates for a number of cancers,\nparticularly leukemia and female breast (see Pickle\net al for more detailed discussion).12 For these\nreasons, we discourage the use of these estimates\nto track year-to-year changes in cancer occurrence\nand death. Age-standardized or age-speci\ufb01c can-\ncer death rates from the NCHS and cancer inci-\ndence rates from SEER or NPCR are the\npreferred data sources for tracking cancer trends,\neven though these data are 3 and 4 years old,\nrespectively, by the time that they become avail-\nable. Despite their limitations, the ACS estimates\nof the number of new cancer cases and deaths\nin the current year provide reasonably accurate\nestimates of the burden of new cancer cases and\ndeaths in the United States. Such estimates will\nassist in continuing efforts to reduce the public\nhealth burden of cancer.\nREFERENCES\n1.

To introduce a multidisciplinary approach for the management of COVID-19-infected \npatients and to report the first operated patient in the Corona unit.\nMethods\u2002 A detailed presentation of the hospital plan for a separate Corona unit with its intensive care unit and operating \nrooms. Description of the management of the first spine surgery case treated in this unit.\nResults\u2002 The Corona unit showed a practical approach for the management of an emergency cervical spine fracture-dislocation \nwith acute paralysis. The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the \ninternal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room. Education of the medical staff and organiza-\ntion of the operating theatre facilitated the management of the patient without an increased risk of spreading the infection.\nConclusions\u2002 The current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary organization of the medical and surgical care of \nthe patients. It is possible to manage an infected or a potentially infected patient surgically, but a multidisciplinary plan is \nnecessary to protect other patients and the medical staff.\nKeywords\u2002 COVID-19\u00a0\u00b7 Emergency\u00a0\u00b7 Cervical fracture\u00a0\u00b7 Corona ward\u00a0\u00b7 Surgical planning\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nIn late 2019, a series of severe acute respiratory syndrome \n(SARS) was reported in China. The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms. Protective masks (FFP3 filtering facepiece particle \nFig.\u202f2\u2002 \u2009A 92-year-old female patient presenting with fracture-dislocation C6-7. Sagittal CT a, facet joint dislocation on the right side b, facet \njoint dislocation on the left side c, MRI examination d and postoperative X-ray showing reduction and fixation e\u200a\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n472\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\n3), head covers and eye goggles are adequately stocked in the \noperating rooms. The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation. Surgical team (a), anaesthesia team (b) and the operating room equipment (c)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n473\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\nthe neurological status was recorded (ASIA B). On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions.

We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.

The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the \ninternal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room.

It is possible to manage an infected or a potentially infected patient surgically, but a multidisciplinary plan is \nnecessary to protect other patients and the medical staff.\nKeywords\u2002 COVID-19\u00a0\u00b7 Emergency\u00a0\u00b7 Cervical fracture\u00a0\u00b7 Corona ward\u00a0\u00b7 Surgical planning\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nIn late 2019, a series of severe acute respiratory syndrome \n(SARS) was reported in China. The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms. Protective masks (FFP3 filtering facepiece particle \nFig.\u202f2\u2002 \u2009A 92-year-old female patient presenting with fracture-dislocation C6-7. Sagittal CT a, facet joint dislocation on the right side b, facet \njoint dislocation on the left side c, MRI examination d and postoperative X-ray showing reduction and fixation e\u200a\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n472\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\n3), head covers and eye goggles are adequately stocked in the \noperating rooms. The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation. Surgical team (a), anaesthesia team (b) and the operating room equipment (c)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n473\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\nthe neurological status was recorded (ASIA B). On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions. Tian et\u00a0al. [17] \nrecently published their experience with telerobotic spinal \nsurgery based on 5G technology. They performed remote \nsurgery in 12 cases and concluded that this technology could \nbuild a connection between surgeons and patients located in \nisolated or rural areas with a lack of medical resources. We \ndo not have experience with this technology; however, this \nmight be an attractive option in such pandemic situations \nprovided the necessary infrastructures are available.\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n474\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nElective spine operations, is\u00a0it the\u00a0right time?\nIn the last few weeks, the number of new cases is signifi-\ncantly reduced. We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.

The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the \ninternal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room.

It is possible to manage an infected or a potentially infected patient surgically, but a multidisciplinary plan is \nnecessary to protect other patients and the medical staff.\nKeywords\u2002 COVID-19\u00a0\u00b7 Emergency\u00a0\u00b7 Cervical fracture\u00a0\u00b7 Corona ward\u00a0\u00b7 Surgical planning\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nIn late 2019, a series of severe acute respiratory syndrome \n(SARS) was reported in China. The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms. Protective masks (FFP3 filtering facepiece particle \nFig.\u202f2\u2002 \u2009A 92-year-old female patient presenting with fracture-dislocation C6-7. Sagittal CT a, facet joint dislocation on the right side b, facet \njoint dislocation on the left side c, MRI examination d and postoperative X-ray showing reduction and fixation e\u200a\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n472\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\n3), head covers and eye goggles are adequately stocked in the \noperating rooms. The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation. Surgical team (a), anaesthesia team (b) and the operating room equipment (c)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n473\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\nthe neurological status was recorded (ASIA B). On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions. Tian et\u00a0al. [17] \nrecently published their experience with telerobotic spinal \nsurgery based on 5G technology. They performed remote \nsurgery in 12 cases and concluded that this technology could \nbuild a connection between surgeons and patients located in \nisolated or rural areas with a lack of medical resources. We \ndo not have experience with this technology; however, this \nmight be an attractive option in such pandemic situations \nprovided the necessary infrastructures are available.\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n474\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nElective spine operations, is\u00a0it the\u00a0right time?\nIn the last few weeks, the number of new cases is signifi-\ncantly reduced. We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.

Thun, MD, MS\nABSTRACT\nEach year, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates the number of new\ncancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the\nmost recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from\nthe National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North\nAmerican Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center\nfor Health Statistics. This report considers incidence data through 2003 and mortality data\nthrough 2004. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million\npopulation. A total of 1,444,920 new cancer cases and 559,650 deaths for cancers are pro-\njected to occur in the United States in 2007. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality\nrates include stabilization of the age-standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates for all can-\ncers combined in men from 1995 through 2003; a continuing increase in the incidence rate by\n0.3% per year in women; and a 13.6% total decrease in age-standardized cancer death rates\namong men and women combined between 1991 and 2004. This report also examines cancer\nincidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year,\nas well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. While the absolute\nnumber of cancer deaths decreased for the second consecutive year in the United States (by\nmore than 3,000 from 2003 to 2004) and much progress has been made in reducing mortality\nrates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in per-\nsons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries\nand by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.

Currently, one in\nfour deaths in the United States is due to cancer. In this article, we provide an overview of cancer statistics, includ-\ning updated incidence, mortality, and survival rates, and expected number of new cancer cases and deaths in 2007.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nData Sources\nMortality data from 1930 to 2004 in the United States were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS).1 Incidence data for long-term trends (1975 to 2003), 5-year relative survival rates, and data on lifetime\nprobability of developing cancer were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) pro-\ngram of the National Cancer Institute, covering about 26% of the US population.2,3,4,5 Incidence data (1995 to 2003)\nfor projecting new cancer cases were obtained from cancer registries that participate in the SEER program or the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), through the\nNorth American Associations of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). State-speci\ufb01c incidence rates were abstracted\nDr. Jemal is Strategic Director, Cancer\nOccurrence, Department of Epidemi-\nology and Surveillance Research,\nAmerican Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.\nMs. Siegel is Manager, Surveillance\nInformation Services, Department of\nEpidemiology and Surveillance Re-\nsearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nDr. Ward is Managing Director, Sur-\nveillance Research, Department of\nEpidemiology and Surveillance Re-\nsearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nMr. Murray is Manager, Surveillance\nData Systems, Department of Epidem-\niology and Surveillance Research,\nAmerican Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.\nMr. Xu is Analyst, Mortality Statistics\nBranch, Division of Vital Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention, Hyattsville, MD.\nDr. Thun is Vice President, Depart-\nment of Epidemiology and Surveillance\nResearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nThis article is available online at\nhttp://CAonline.AmCancerSoc.org\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nfrom Cancer in North America (1999\u20132003) Volume\nOne,6 based on data collected by cancer reg-\nistries participating in the SEER program and\nNPCR. Population data were obtained from the\nUS Census Bureau.7 Causes of death were coded\nand classified according to the International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD-8, ICD-9, and\nICD-10).8,9,10 Cancer cases were classi\ufb01ed accord-\ning to the International Classification of Diseases\nfor Oncology.11\nEstimated New Cancer Cases\nThe precise number of cancer cases diagnosed\neach year in the nation and in every state is un-\nknown because complete cancer registration has\nnot yet been achieved in some states. Since the\nAmerican Cancer Society (ACS) began produc-\ning estimates of new cancer cases in the current\nyear, the method has been re\ufb01ned several times\nto take advantage of improvements in data and\nstatistical methods. Beginning with 2007, we\nare using a new projection method described by\nPickle et al12 in an accompanying article in\nthis issue of CA. The new method is a spatio-\ntemporal model based on incidence data from\n1995 through 2003 from 41 states that met\nNAACCR\u2019s high-quality data standard for inci-\ndence, covering about 86% of the US popula-\ntion. This contrasts with the previous quadratic\nautoregressive model based on incidence data\nfrom the nine oldest SEER registries, covering\nabout 10% of the US population. Furthermore,\nthe new method considers geographic varia-\ntions in socio-demographic and lifestyle fac-\ntors, medical settings, and cancer screening\nbehaviors as predictors of incidence, and accounts\nfor expected delays in case reporting.\nEstimated Cancer Deaths\nWe used the state-space prediction method13\nto estimate the number of cancer deaths expected\nto occur in the United States and in each state\nin the year 2007. Projections are based on under-\nlying cause-of-death from death certificates as\nreported to the NCHS.1 This model projects\nthe number of cancer deaths expected to occur\nin 2007 based on the number that occurred each\nyear from 1969 to 2004 in the United States and\nin each state separately.\nOther Statistics\nWe provide mortality statistics for the lead-\ning causes of death as well as deaths from cancer\nin the year 2004. Causes of death for 2004 were\ncoded and classi\ufb01ed according to ICD-10.8 This\nreport also provides updated statistics on trends\nin cancer incidence and mortality rates, the prob-\nability of developing cancer, and 5-year relative\nsurvival rates for selected cancer sites based on data\nfrom 1975 through 2003.3 All age-adjusted inci-\ndence and death rates are standardized to the\n2000 US standard population and expressed per\n100,000 population.\nThe long-term incidence rates and trends\n(1975 to 2003) are adjusted for delays in report-\ning where possible. Delayed reporting affects the\nmost recent 1 to 3 years of incidence data (in\nthis case, 2001 to 2003), especially for cancers\nsuch as melanoma and prostate that are frequently\ndiagnosed in outpatient settings. The National\nCancer Institute (NCI) has developed a method\nto account for expected reporting delays in SEER\nregistries for all cancer sites combined and sev-\neral speci\ufb01c cancer sites when long-term inci-\ndence trends are analyzed.14 Delay-adjusted trends\nprovide a more accurate assessment of trends in\nthe most recent years for which data are available.\nSELECTED FINDINGS \nExpected Numbers of New Cancer Cases \nTable 1 presents estimated numbers of new\ncases of invasive cancer expected among men\nand women in the United States in 2007. The\noverall estimate of about 1.44 million new cases\ndoes not include carcinoma in situ of any site\nexcept urinary bladder, nor does it include basal\ncell and squamous cell cancers of the skin. More\nthan 1 million additional cases of basal cell and\nsquamous cell skin cancer, about 62,030 cases\nof breast carcinoma in situ, and 48,290 cases of\nin situ melanoma are expected to be newly diag-\nnosed in 2007. Because of the introduction of\na new projection method, estimates have been\naffected for many individual cancer sites, par-\nticularly for leukemia, female breast, lung, and\nprostate cancers. The estimated numbers of new\ncancer cases for each state and selected cancer\nsites are shown in Table 2.\nCancer Statistics, 2007\n44\nCA A Cancer Journal for Clinicians\n 15424863, 2007, 1, Downloaded from https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.57.1.43, Wiley Online Library on [06/02/2026].

It is estimated\nthat about 559,650 Americans will die from can-\ncer, corresponding to over 1,500 deaths per day.\nCancers of the lung and bronchus, prostate, and\ncolon and rectum in men, and cancers of the lung\nand bronchus, breast, and colon and rectum in\nwomen continue to be the most common fatal\ncancers. These four cancers account for half of\nthe total cancer deaths among men and women\n(Figure 1). Lung cancer surpassed breast cancer\nas the leading cause of cancer death in women in\n1987. Lung cancer is expected to account for 26%\nof all female cancer deaths in 2007. Table 3 pro-\nvides the estimated number of cancer deaths in\n2007 by state for selected cancer sites.\nRegional Variations in Cancer Rates\nTable 4 depicts cancer incidence for select\ncancers by state. Rates vary widely across states.\nFor example, among the cancers listed in Table\n4, the largest variations in the incidence rates,\nin proportionate terms, occurred in lung can-\ncer, in which rates (cases per 100,000 popula-\ntion) ranged from 41.8 in men and 21.5 in\nwomen in Utah to 137.9 in men and 73.5 in\nwomen in Kentucky. In contrast, the variation\nin female breast cancer incidence rates was small,\nranging from 115 cases per 100,000 population\nin New Mexico to 146.7 cases in Washington.\nFactors that contribute to the state variations in\nthe incidence rates include differences in the\nprevalence of risk factors, access to and utiliza-\ntion of early detection services, and complete-\nness of reporting. For example, the state variation\nin lung cancer incidence rates primarily re\ufb02ects\ndifferences in smoking prevalence; Utah ranks\nlowest in adult smoking prevalence and Kentucky\nhighest.\nTrends in Cancer Incidence and Mortality\nFigures 2 to 5 depict long-term trends in\ncancer incidence and death rates for all cancers\ncombined and for selected cancer sites by sex.\nTable 5 shows incidence and mortality patterns\nfor all cancer sites combined and for the four\nmost common cancer sites based on joinpoint\nanalysis. Trends in incidence were adjusted for\ndelayed reporting. Delay-adjusted cancer inci-\ndence rates for all sites combined stabilized in\nmen from 1995 to 2003 and increased in women\nby 0.3% per year from 1987 to 2003. \nLung cancer incidence rates are declining in\nmen and appear to be plateauing in women after\nincreasing for many decades. The lag in the tem-\nporal trend of lung cancer incidence rates in\nwomen compared with men reflects historical\ndifferences in cigarette smoking between men\nand women; cigarette smoking in women peaked\nabout 20 years later than in men. Colorectal can-\ncer incidence rates have decreased from 1998\nthrough 2003 in both males and in females. Female\nbreast cancer incidence rates leveled off from\n2001 to 2003 after increasing since 1980, which\nmay re\ufb02ect the saturation of mammography uti-\nlization and reduction in the use of hormone\nreplacement therapy.15 Prostate cancer incidence\nrates continued to increase, although at a slower\nrate than those reported for the early 1990s and\nbefore. The continuing increase for prostate can-\ncer may be attributable to increased screening\nthrough prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen (PSA) testing.15\nDeath rates for all cancer sites combined\ndecreased by 1.6% per year from 1993 to 2003\nin males and by 0.8% per year in females from\n1992 to 2003. Mortality rates have continued\nto decrease across all four major cancer sites in\nmen and in women, except for female lung can-\ncer in which rates continued to increase by 0.3%\nper year from 1995 to 2003 (Table 5).\nTable 6 shows the contribution of individual\ncancer sites to the total decrease in overall can-\ncer death rates. Death rates from all cancers com-\nbined peaked in 1990 for men and in 1991 for\nwomen. Between 1990/1991 and 2003, death\nrates from cancer decreased by 16.3% among men\nand by 8.5% among women. Among men, reduc-\ntion in death rates from lung, prostate, and colorec-\ntal cancers accounts for about 80% of the decrease\nin cancer death rates, while reduction in death\nrates from breast and colorectal cancers accounts\nfor over 60% of the decrease among women. Lung\ncancer in men and breast cancer in women alone\naccount for nearly 40% of the sex-speci\ufb01c decreases\nin cancer death rates. The decrease in lung can-\ncer death rates among men is due to reduction\nin tobacco use over the past 40 years, while the\ndecrease in death rates from female breast, col-\norectal, and prostate cancer largely re\ufb02ects improve-\nments in early detection and treatment.

African\nAmerican women have a 9% lower incidence rate,\nbut an 18% higher death rate than White women\nfor all cancer sites combined. For the speci\ufb01c can-\ncer sites listed in Table 11, incidence and death\nrates are consistently higher in African Americans\nthan in Whites, except for breast cancer (inci-\ndence) and lung and kidney cancers (incidence\nand mortality) among women. Death rates from\nprostate, stomach, and cervical cancers among\nAfrican Americans are more than twice those in\nWhites. Factors known to contribute to racial\ndisparities in mortality vary by cancer site. These\nfactors include differences in exposure to under-\nlying risk factors (eg, Helicobacter pylori for stom-\nach cancer), access to high-quality regular screening\n(breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers), and timely\ndiagnosis and treatment (for many cancers). The\nhigher breast cancer incidence rates among Whites\nare thought to re\ufb02ect a combination of factors\nthat affect diagnosis (such as more frequent mam-\nmography in White women until the most recent\ntime period) and those that affect disease risk\n(such as later age at \ufb01rst birth and greater use of\nhormone replacement therapy among White than\nAfrican American women).16\nAmong other racial and ethnic groups, can-\ncer incidence and death rates are lower than\n53\nVolume 57 \u2022 Number 1 \u2022 January/February 2007\nCA Cancer J Clin 2007;57:43\u201366\nFIGURE 4\nAnnual Age-adjusted Cancer Death Rates* Among Males for Selected Cancers, US, 1930 to 2003.\n*Rates are age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.

However, the incidence and\ndeath rates are generally higher in minority pop-\nulations than in Whites for cancers of the uter-\nine cervix, stomach, and liver. Stomach and liver\ncancer incidence and death rates are more than\ntwice as high in Asian American/Paci\ufb01c Islanders\nas in Whites, reflecting increased exposure to\ninfectious agents such as Helicobacter pylori and\nhepatitis B.17 Kidney cancer incidence and death\nrates are the highest among American Indians/\nAlaskan Natives, although factors that contribute\nto this are unknown.\nTrends in cancer incidence can only be\nadjusted for delayed reporting in Whites and\nAfrican Americans, and not in other racial and\nethnic subgroups, because long-term incidence\ndata required for delay adjustment are available\nonly for Whites and African Americans. From\n1995 to 2003, sex-specific incidence rates for\nall cancer sites combined, not adjusted for delayed\nreporting, have stabilized, except for African\nAmerican and Hispanic men, in whom rates\ndecreased by 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively.

However, because of the relatively\nearly age of breast cancer onset, women have a\nslightly higher probability of developing cancer\nbefore age 60 years. It is noteworthy that these esti-\nmates are based on the average experience of the\ngeneral population and may over- or underesti-\nmate individual risk because of differences in\nexposure and/or genetic susceptibility.\nCancer Survival by Race\nCompared with Whites, African American\nmen and women have poorer survival once a\ncancer diagnosis is made. As shown in Figure 7,\nAfrican Americans are less likely than Whites to\nbe diagnosed with cancer at a localized stage,\nwhen the disease may be more easily and suc-\ncessfully treated, and are more likely to be diag-\nnosed with cancer at a regional or distant stage of\ndisease. Five-year relative survival is lower in\nAfrican Americans than Whites within each stra-\ntum of stage of diagnosis for nearly every cancer\nsite (Figure 8). These disparities may result from\ninequalities in access to and receipt of quality\nhealth care and/or within-stage differences in\ntumor characteristics. The contribution of  these\nfactors, individually or collectively, to the differ-\nential survival for specific cancers is unclear.18\nHowever, some studies suggest that African\n55\nVolume 57 \u2022 Number 1 \u2022 January/February 2007\nCA Cancer J Clin 2007;57:43\u201366\nLine Segment 1\nLine Segment 2\nLine Segment 3\nLine Segment 4\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nAll sites\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1983\n0.9 \u2020\n1983-1992\n1.8 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-1.5\n1995-2003\n0.1\nMale\n1975-1989\n1.3 \u2020\n1989-1992\n5.1 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-4.5 \u2020\n1995-2003\n0.0\nFemale\n1975-1979\n-0.3\n1979-1987\n1.6 \u2020\n1987-2003\n0.3 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1990\n0.5 \u2020\n1990-1994\n-0.4\n1994-2003\n-1.1 \u2020\nMale  \n1975-1979\n1.0 \u2020\n1979-1990\n0.3 \u2020\n1990-1993\n-0.4\n1993-2003\n-1.6 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1992\n0.5 \u2020\n1992-2003\n-0.8 \u2020\nLung & bronchus\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1982\n2.5 \u2020\n1982-1991\n0.9 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-0.7 \u2020\nMale   \n1975-1982\n1.5 \u2020\n1982-1991\n-0.5 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-1.7 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1982\n5.6 \u2020\n1982-1991\n3.4 \u2020\n1991-2003\n0.5 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1980\n3.0 \u2020\n1980-1990\n1.8 \u2020\n1990-1994\n-0.1\n1994-2003\n-0.9 \u2020\nMale  \n1975-1978\n2.4 \u2020\n1978-1984\n1.2 \u2020\n1984-1991\n0.3 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1982\n6.0 \u2020\n1982-1990\n4.2 \u2020\n1990-1995\n1.7 \u2020\n1995-2003\n0.3 \u2020\nColon & rectum\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1985\n0.8 \u2020\n1985-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.2\n1998-2003\n-2.1 \u2020\nMale    \n1975-1986\n1.1 \u2020\n1986-1995\n-2.1 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.0\n1998-2003\n-2.5 \u2020\nFemale  \n1975-1985\n0.3\n1985-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.7\n1998-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1978\n0.2\n1978-1985\n-0.8 \u2020\n1985-2001\n-1.8 \u2020\n2001-2003\n-2.8 \u2020\nMale   \n1975-1978\n0.8\n1978-1984\n-0.4\n1984-1990\n-1.3 \u2020\n1990-2003\n-2.1 \u2020\nFemale  \n1975-1984\n-1.0 \u2020\n1984-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nBreast (female)\nIncidence\n1975-1980\n-0.4\n1980-1987\n3.7 \u2020\n1987-2001\n0.5 \u2020\n2001-2003\n-4.1\nDeath\n1975-1990\n0.4 \u2020\n1990-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1999\n-3.1 \u2020\n1999-2003\n-1.4 \u2020\nProstate\nIncidence\n1975-1988\n2.6 \u2020\n1988-1992\n16.4 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-10.8 \u2020\n1995-2003\n1.1 \u2020\nDeath\n1975-1987\n0.9 \u2020\n1987-1991\n3.1 \u2020\n1991-1994\n-0.6\n1994-2003\n-4.0 \u2020\n*Annual percent change based on incidence (delay-adjusted) and mortality rates age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.\n\u2020The APC is significantly different from zero.\nNote: Trends were analyzed by Joinpoint Regression Program, version 3.1, with a maximum of three joinpoints (ie, four line segments).\nTABLE 5\nTrends in Cancer Incidence and Death Rates for Selected Cancers by Sex, US, 1975 to 2003\nSource: Ries LAG, Harkins D, Krapcho M, et al., eds.

This is true for both Whites and African\nAmericans. Cancers for which survival has not\nimproved substantially over the past 25 years\ninclude uterine corpus, cervix, larynx, lung,\nand pancreas.\nRelative survival rates cannot be calculated\nfor other racial and ethnic populations because\naccurate life expectancies (the average number\nof years of life remaining for persons who have\nattained a given age) are not available. However,\nbased on cause-speci\ufb01c survival rates of cancer\npatients diagnosed from 1992 to 2000 in SEER\nareas of the United States, all minority popula-\ntions, except Asian American/Pacific Islander\nwomen, have a greater probability of dying from\ncancer within 5 years of diagnosis than non-\nHispanic Whites, after accounting for differ-\nences in stage at diagnosis.15,20 For the four major\ncancer sites (prostate, female breast, lung and\nbronchus, and colon and rectum), minority pop-\nulations are more likely to be diagnosed at dis-\ntant stage, compared with non-Hispanic Whites.20\nCANCER IN CHILDREN\nCancer is the second leading cause of death\namong children between age 1 to 14 years in\nthe United States; accidents are the most fre-\nquent cause of death in this age group (Table\n14). The most common cancers in children (aged\n0 to 14 years) are leukemia (particularly acute\nlymphocytic leukemia), brain and other nerv-\nous system cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, non-\nHodgkin lymphoma, and renal (Wilms) tumors.3\nOver the past 25 years, there have been signi\ufb01-\ncant improvements in the 5-year relative sur-\nvival rate for many childhood cancers (Table 15).\nThe 5-year relative survival rate among children\nfor all cancer sites combined improved from 58%\nfor patients diagnosed in 1975 to 1977 to 79%\nfor those diagnosed in 1996 to 2002.3\n70 and\nBirth to\nBirth to 39\n40 to 59\n60 to 69\nOlder\nDeath\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\nAll sites\u2020\nMale\n1.42 (1 in 70)\n8.69 (1 in 12)\n16.58 (1 in 6)\n39.44 (1 in 3)\n45.31 (1 in 2)\nFemale\n2.03 (1 in 49)\n9.09 (1 in 11)\n10.57 (1 in 9)\n26.60 (1 in 4)\n37.86 (1 in 3)\nUrinary bladder\nMale\n.02 (1 in 4381)\n.41 (1 in 241)\n.96 (1 in 105)\n3.41 (1 in 29)\n3.61 (1 in 28)\nFemale\n.01 (1 in 9527)\n.13 (1 in 782)\n.26 (1 in 379)\n.96 (1 in 105)\n1.14 (1 in 87)\nBreast\nFemale\n.48 (1 in 210)\n3.98 (1 in 25)\n3.65 (1 in 27)\n6.84 (1 in 15)\n12.67 (1 in 8)\nColon & rectum\nMale\n.07 (1 in 1342)\n.93 (1 in 107)\n1.67 (1 in 60)\n4.92 (1 in 20)\n5.79 (1 in 17)\nFemale\n.07 (1 in 1469)\n.73 (1 in 138)\n1.16 (1 in 86)\n4.45 (1 in 22)\n5.37 (1 in 19)\nLeukemia\nMale\n.16 (1 in 640)\n.22 (1 in 452)\n.35 (1 in 286)\n1.17 (1 in 86)\n1.49 (1 in 67)\nFemale\n.12 (1 in 820)\n.14 (1 in 694)\n.20 (1 in 491)\n.75 (1 in 132)\n1.05 (1 in 95)\nLung & bronchus\nMale\n.03 (1 in 3146)\n1.09 (1 in 92)\n2.61 (1 in 38)\n6.76 (1 in 15)\n8.02 (1 in 12)\nFemale\n.04 (1 in 2779)\n.85 (1 in 117)\n1.84 (1 in 54)\n4.52 (1 in 22)\n6.15 (1 in 16)\nMelanoma of the skin\nMale\n.13 (1 in 775)\n.53 (1 in 187)\n.56 (1 in 178)\n1.32 (1 in 76)\n2.04 (1 in 49)\nFemale\n.21 (1 in 467)\n.42 (1 in 237)\n.29 (1 in 347)\n.62 (1 in 163)\n1.38 (1 in 73)\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nMale\n.14 (1 in 735)\n.45 (1 in 222)\n.57 (1 in 176)\n1.56 (1 in 64)\n2.14 (1 in 47)\nFemale\n.08 (1 in 1200)\n.32 (1 in 313)\n.44 (1 in 229)\n1.30 (1 in 77)\n1.83 (1 in 55)\nProstate\nMale\n.01 (1 in 10373)\n2.59 (1 in 39)\n7.03 (1 in 14)\n13.83 (1 in 7)\n17.12 (1 in 6)\nUterine cervix\nFemale\n.16 (1 in 631)\n.29 (1 in 346)\n.14 (1 in 695)\n.20 (1 in 512)\n.73 (1 in 138)\nUterine corpus\nFemale\n.06 (1 in 1652)\n.70 (1 in 142)\n.81 (1 in 124)\n1.28 (1 in 78)\n2.49 (1 in 40)\n*For those free of cancer at beginning of age interval.

These estimates may vary con-\nsiderably from year to year, particularly for less\ncommon cancers and in states with smaller pop-\nulations. Unanticipated changes may occur that\nare not captured by modeling techniques.\nEstimates are also affected by changes in method.\nThe introduction of a new method for estimat-\ning new cancer cases in 2007 has substantially\naffected the estimates for a number of cancers,\nparticularly leukemia and female breast (see Pickle\net al for more detailed discussion).12 For these\nreasons, we discourage the use of these estimates\nto track year-to-year changes in cancer occurrence\nand death. Age-standardized or age-speci\ufb01c can-\ncer death rates from the NCHS and cancer inci-\ndence rates from SEER or NPCR are the\npreferred data sources for tracking cancer trends,\neven though these data are 3 and 4 years old,\nrespectively, by the time that they become avail-\nable. Despite their limitations, the ACS estimates\nof the number of new cancer cases and deaths\nin the current year provide reasonably accurate\nestimates of the burden of new cancer cases and\ndeaths in the United States. Such estimates will\nassist in continuing efforts to reduce the public\nhealth burden of cancer.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Thun, MD, MS\nABSTRACT\nEach year, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates the number of new\ncancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the\nmost recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from\nthe National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North\nAmerican Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center\nfor Health Statistics. This report considers incidence data through 2003 and mortality data\nthrough 2004. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million\npopulation. A total of 1,444,920 new cancer cases and 559,650 deaths for cancers are pro-\njected to occur in the United States in 2007. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality\nrates include stabilization of the age-standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates for all can-\ncers combined in men from 1995 through 2003; a continuing increase in the incidence rate by\n0.3% per year in women; and a 13.6% total decrease in age-standardized cancer death rates\namong men and women combined between 1991 and 2004. This report also examines cancer\nincidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year,\nas well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. While the absolute\nnumber of cancer deaths decreased for the second consecutive year in the United States (by\nmore than 3,000 from 2003 to 2004) and much progress has been made in reducing mortality\nrates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in per-\nsons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries\nand by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.

Currently, one in\nfour deaths in the United States is due to cancer. In this article, we provide an overview of cancer statistics, includ-\ning updated incidence, mortality, and survival rates, and expected number of new cancer cases and deaths in 2007.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nData Sources\nMortality data from 1930 to 2004 in the United States were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS).1 Incidence data for long-term trends (1975 to 2003), 5-year relative survival rates, and data on lifetime\nprobability of developing cancer were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) pro-\ngram of the National Cancer Institute, covering about 26% of the US population.2,3,4,5 Incidence data (1995 to 2003)\nfor projecting new cancer cases were obtained from cancer registries that participate in the SEER program or the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), through the\nNorth American Associations of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). State-speci\ufb01c incidence rates were abstracted\nDr. Jemal is Strategic Director, Cancer\nOccurrence, Department of Epidemi-\nology and Surveillance Research,\nAmerican Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.\nMs. Siegel is Manager, Surveillance\nInformation Services, Department of\nEpidemiology and Surveillance Re-\nsearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nDr. Ward is Managing Director, Sur-\nveillance Research, Department of\nEpidemiology and Surveillance Re-\nsearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nMr. Murray is Manager, Surveillance\nData Systems, Department of Epidem-\niology and Surveillance Research,\nAmerican Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.\nMr. Xu is Analyst, Mortality Statistics\nBranch, Division of Vital Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention, Hyattsville, MD.\nDr. Thun is Vice President, Depart-\nment of Epidemiology and Surveillance\nResearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nThis article is available online at\nhttp://CAonline.AmCancerSoc.org\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nfrom Cancer in North America (1999\u20132003) Volume\nOne,6 based on data collected by cancer reg-\nistries participating in the SEER program and\nNPCR. Population data were obtained from the\nUS Census Bureau.7 Causes of death were coded\nand classified according to the International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD-8, ICD-9, and\nICD-10).8,9,10 Cancer cases were classi\ufb01ed accord-\ning to the International Classification of Diseases\nfor Oncology.11\nEstimated New Cancer Cases\nThe precise number of cancer cases diagnosed\neach year in the nation and in every state is un-\nknown because complete cancer registration has\nnot yet been achieved in some states. Since the\nAmerican Cancer Society (ACS) began produc-\ning estimates of new cancer cases in the current\nyear, the method has been re\ufb01ned several times\nto take advantage of improvements in data and\nstatistical methods. Beginning with 2007, we\nare using a new projection method described by\nPickle et al12 in an accompanying article in\nthis issue of CA. The new method is a spatio-\ntemporal model based on incidence data from\n1995 through 2003 from 41 states that met\nNAACCR\u2019s high-quality data standard for inci-\ndence, covering about 86% of the US popula-\ntion. This contrasts with the previous quadratic\nautoregressive model based on incidence data\nfrom the nine oldest SEER registries, covering\nabout 10% of the US population. Furthermore,\nthe new method considers geographic varia-\ntions in socio-demographic and lifestyle fac-\ntors, medical settings, and cancer screening\nbehaviors as predictors of incidence, and accounts\nfor expected delays in case reporting.\nEstimated Cancer Deaths\nWe used the state-space prediction method13\nto estimate the number of cancer deaths expected\nto occur in the United States and in each state\nin the year 2007. Projections are based on under-\nlying cause-of-death from death certificates as\nreported to the NCHS.1 This model projects\nthe number of cancer deaths expected to occur\nin 2007 based on the number that occurred each\nyear from 1969 to 2004 in the United States and\nin each state separately.\nOther Statistics\nWe provide mortality statistics for the lead-\ning causes of death as well as deaths from cancer\nin the year 2004. Causes of death for 2004 were\ncoded and classi\ufb01ed according to ICD-10.8 This\nreport also provides updated statistics on trends\nin cancer incidence and mortality rates, the prob-\nability of developing cancer, and 5-year relative\nsurvival rates for selected cancer sites based on data\nfrom 1975 through 2003.3 All age-adjusted inci-\ndence and death rates are standardized to the\n2000 US standard population and expressed per\n100,000 population.\nThe long-term incidence rates and trends\n(1975 to 2003) are adjusted for delays in report-\ning where possible. Delayed reporting affects the\nmost recent 1 to 3 years of incidence data (in\nthis case, 2001 to 2003), especially for cancers\nsuch as melanoma and prostate that are frequently\ndiagnosed in outpatient settings. The National\nCancer Institute (NCI) has developed a method\nto account for expected reporting delays in SEER\nregistries for all cancer sites combined and sev-\neral speci\ufb01c cancer sites when long-term inci-\ndence trends are analyzed.14 Delay-adjusted trends\nprovide a more accurate assessment of trends in\nthe most recent years for which data are available.\nSELECTED FINDINGS \nExpected Numbers of New Cancer Cases \nTable 1 presents estimated numbers of new\ncases of invasive cancer expected among men\nand women in the United States in 2007. The\noverall estimate of about 1.44 million new cases\ndoes not include carcinoma in situ of any site\nexcept urinary bladder, nor does it include basal\ncell and squamous cell cancers of the skin. More\nthan 1 million additional cases of basal cell and\nsquamous cell skin cancer, about 62,030 cases\nof breast carcinoma in situ, and 48,290 cases of\nin situ melanoma are expected to be newly diag-\nnosed in 2007. Because of the introduction of\na new projection method, estimates have been\naffected for many individual cancer sites, par-\nticularly for leukemia, female breast, lung, and\nprostate cancers. The estimated numbers of new\ncancer cases for each state and selected cancer\nsites are shown in Table 2.\nCancer Statistics, 2007\n44\nCA A Cancer Journal for Clinicians\n 15424863, 2007, 1, Downloaded from https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.57.1.43, Wiley Online Library on [06/02/2026].

It is estimated\nthat about 559,650 Americans will die from can-\ncer, corresponding to over 1,500 deaths per day.\nCancers of the lung and bronchus, prostate, and\ncolon and rectum in men, and cancers of the lung\nand bronchus, breast, and colon and rectum in\nwomen continue to be the most common fatal\ncancers. These four cancers account for half of\nthe total cancer deaths among men and women\n(Figure 1). Lung cancer surpassed breast cancer\nas the leading cause of cancer death in women in\n1987. Lung cancer is expected to account for 26%\nof all female cancer deaths in 2007. Table 3 pro-\nvides the estimated number of cancer deaths in\n2007 by state for selected cancer sites.\nRegional Variations in Cancer Rates\nTable 4 depicts cancer incidence for select\ncancers by state. Rates vary widely across states.\nFor example, among the cancers listed in Table\n4, the largest variations in the incidence rates,\nin proportionate terms, occurred in lung can-\ncer, in which rates (cases per 100,000 popula-\ntion) ranged from 41.8 in men and 21.5 in\nwomen in Utah to 137.9 in men and 73.5 in\nwomen in Kentucky. In contrast, the variation\nin female breast cancer incidence rates was small,\nranging from 115 cases per 100,000 population\nin New Mexico to 146.7 cases in Washington.\nFactors that contribute to the state variations in\nthe incidence rates include differences in the\nprevalence of risk factors, access to and utiliza-\ntion of early detection services, and complete-\nness of reporting. For example, the state variation\nin lung cancer incidence rates primarily re\ufb02ects\ndifferences in smoking prevalence; Utah ranks\nlowest in adult smoking prevalence and Kentucky\nhighest.\nTrends in Cancer Incidence and Mortality\nFigures 2 to 5 depict long-term trends in\ncancer incidence and death rates for all cancers\ncombined and for selected cancer sites by sex.\nTable 5 shows incidence and mortality patterns\nfor all cancer sites combined and for the four\nmost common cancer sites based on joinpoint\nanalysis. Trends in incidence were adjusted for\ndelayed reporting. Delay-adjusted cancer inci-\ndence rates for all sites combined stabilized in\nmen from 1995 to 2003 and increased in women\nby 0.3% per year from 1987 to 2003. \nLung cancer incidence rates are declining in\nmen and appear to be plateauing in women after\nincreasing for many decades. The lag in the tem-\nporal trend of lung cancer incidence rates in\nwomen compared with men reflects historical\ndifferences in cigarette smoking between men\nand women; cigarette smoking in women peaked\nabout 20 years later than in men. Colorectal can-\ncer incidence rates have decreased from 1998\nthrough 2003 in both males and in females. Female\nbreast cancer incidence rates leveled off from\n2001 to 2003 after increasing since 1980, which\nmay re\ufb02ect the saturation of mammography uti-\nlization and reduction in the use of hormone\nreplacement therapy.15 Prostate cancer incidence\nrates continued to increase, although at a slower\nrate than those reported for the early 1990s and\nbefore. The continuing increase for prostate can-\ncer may be attributable to increased screening\nthrough prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen (PSA) testing.15\nDeath rates for all cancer sites combined\ndecreased by 1.6% per year from 1993 to 2003\nin males and by 0.8% per year in females from\n1992 to 2003. Mortality rates have continued\nto decrease across all four major cancer sites in\nmen and in women, except for female lung can-\ncer in which rates continued to increase by 0.3%\nper year from 1995 to 2003 (Table 5).\nTable 6 shows the contribution of individual\ncancer sites to the total decrease in overall can-\ncer death rates. Death rates from all cancers com-\nbined peaked in 1990 for men and in 1991 for\nwomen. Between 1990/1991 and 2003, death\nrates from cancer decreased by 16.3% among men\nand by 8.5% among women. Among men, reduc-\ntion in death rates from lung, prostate, and colorec-\ntal cancers accounts for about 80% of the decrease\nin cancer death rates, while reduction in death\nrates from breast and colorectal cancers accounts\nfor over 60% of the decrease among women. Lung\ncancer in men and breast cancer in women alone\naccount for nearly 40% of the sex-speci\ufb01c decreases\nin cancer death rates. The decrease in lung can-\ncer death rates among men is due to reduction\nin tobacco use over the past 40 years, while the\ndecrease in death rates from female breast, col-\norectal, and prostate cancer largely re\ufb02ects improve-\nments in early detection and treatment.

Cancer\nis the leading cause of death among women\naged 40 to 79 years and among men aged 60 to\n79 years. When age-adjusted death rates are\nconsidered (Figure 6), cancer is the leading\ncause of death among men and women under\nage 85 years. A total of  473,535 people under\nage 85 years died from cancer in the United\nStates in 2004, compared with 414,526 deaths\nfrom heart disease.\nTable 9 presents the number of deaths from all\ncancers combined and the five most common\ncancer sites for males and females at various ages.\nAmong males under age 40 years, leukemia is\nthe most common fatal cancer, while cancer of\nthe lung and bronchus predominates in men\naged 40 years and older. The second most com-\nmon cause of cancer death is colorectal cancer\namong men aged 40 to 79 years and prostate\ncancer among men aged 80 years and older.\nAmong females, leukemia is the leading cause\nof cancer death before age 20 years, breast can-\ncer ranks first at age 20 to 59 years, and lung\ncancer ranks \ufb01rst at age 60 years and older.\nFrom 2003 to 2004, the number of recorded\ncancer deaths decreased by 1,160 in men and by\n1,854 in women (Table 10).

African\nAmerican women have a 9% lower incidence rate,\nbut an 18% higher death rate than White women\nfor all cancer sites combined. For the speci\ufb01c can-\ncer sites listed in Table 11, incidence and death\nrates are consistently higher in African Americans\nthan in Whites, except for breast cancer (inci-\ndence) and lung and kidney cancers (incidence\nand mortality) among women. Death rates from\nprostate, stomach, and cervical cancers among\nAfrican Americans are more than twice those in\nWhites. Factors known to contribute to racial\ndisparities in mortality vary by cancer site. These\nfactors include differences in exposure to under-\nlying risk factors (eg, Helicobacter pylori for stom-\nach cancer), access to high-quality regular screening\n(breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers), and timely\ndiagnosis and treatment (for many cancers). The\nhigher breast cancer incidence rates among Whites\nare thought to re\ufb02ect a combination of factors\nthat affect diagnosis (such as more frequent mam-\nmography in White women until the most recent\ntime period) and those that affect disease risk\n(such as later age at \ufb01rst birth and greater use of\nhormone replacement therapy among White than\nAfrican American women).16\nAmong other racial and ethnic groups, can-\ncer incidence and death rates are lower than\n53\nVolume 57 \u2022 Number 1 \u2022 January/February 2007\nCA Cancer J Clin 2007;57:43\u201366\nFIGURE 4\nAnnual Age-adjusted Cancer Death Rates* Among Males for Selected Cancers, US, 1930 to 2003.\n*Rates are age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.

However, the incidence and\ndeath rates are generally higher in minority pop-\nulations than in Whites for cancers of the uter-\nine cervix, stomach, and liver. Stomach and liver\ncancer incidence and death rates are more than\ntwice as high in Asian American/Paci\ufb01c Islanders\nas in Whites, reflecting increased exposure to\ninfectious agents such as Helicobacter pylori and\nhepatitis B.17 Kidney cancer incidence and death\nrates are the highest among American Indians/\nAlaskan Natives, although factors that contribute\nto this are unknown.\nTrends in cancer incidence can only be\nadjusted for delayed reporting in Whites and\nAfrican Americans, and not in other racial and\nethnic subgroups, because long-term incidence\ndata required for delay adjustment are available\nonly for Whites and African Americans. From\n1995 to 2003, sex-specific incidence rates for\nall cancer sites combined, not adjusted for delayed\nreporting, have stabilized, except for African\nAmerican and Hispanic men, in whom rates\ndecreased by 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively. In\ncontrast, death rates from cancer significantly\ndecreased in each racial and ethnic group, with\nlarger decreases in men than in women.3\nCancer Statistics, 2007\n54\nCA A Cancer Journal for Clinicians\nFIGURE 5\nAnnual Age-adjusted Cancer Death Rates* Among Females for Selected Cancers, US, 1930 to 2003.\n*Rates are age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.\n\u2020Uterus includes uterine cervix and uterine corpus.\nNote: Due to changes in ICD coding, numerator information has changed over time.

However, because of the relatively\nearly age of breast cancer onset, women have a\nslightly higher probability of developing cancer\nbefore age 60 years. It is noteworthy that these esti-\nmates are based on the average experience of the\ngeneral population and may over- or underesti-\nmate individual risk because of differences in\nexposure and/or genetic susceptibility.\nCancer Survival by Race\nCompared with Whites, African American\nmen and women have poorer survival once a\ncancer diagnosis is made. As shown in Figure 7,\nAfrican Americans are less likely than Whites to\nbe diagnosed with cancer at a localized stage,\nwhen the disease may be more easily and suc-\ncessfully treated, and are more likely to be diag-\nnosed with cancer at a regional or distant stage of\ndisease. Five-year relative survival is lower in\nAfrican Americans than Whites within each stra-\ntum of stage of diagnosis for nearly every cancer\nsite (Figure 8). These disparities may result from\ninequalities in access to and receipt of quality\nhealth care and/or within-stage differences in\ntumor characteristics.

This is true for both Whites and African\nAmericans. Cancers for which survival has not\nimproved substantially over the past 25 years\ninclude uterine corpus, cervix, larynx, lung,\nand pancreas.\nRelative survival rates cannot be calculated\nfor other racial and ethnic populations because\naccurate life expectancies (the average number\nof years of life remaining for persons who have\nattained a given age) are not available. However,\nbased on cause-speci\ufb01c survival rates of cancer\npatients diagnosed from 1992 to 2000 in SEER\nareas of the United States, all minority popula-\ntions, except Asian American/Pacific Islander\nwomen, have a greater probability of dying from\ncancer within 5 years of diagnosis than non-\nHispanic Whites, after accounting for differ-\nences in stage at diagnosis.15,20 For the four major\ncancer sites (prostate, female breast, lung and\nbronchus, and colon and rectum), minority pop-\nulations are more likely to be diagnosed at dis-\ntant stage, compared with non-Hispanic Whites.20\nCANCER IN CHILDREN\nCancer is the second leading cause of death\namong children between age 1 to 14 years in\nthe United States; accidents are the most fre-\nquent cause of death in this age group (Table\n14). The most common cancers in children (aged\n0 to 14 years) are leukemia (particularly acute\nlymphocytic leukemia), brain and other nerv-\nous system cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, non-\nHodgkin lymphoma, and renal (Wilms) tumors.3\nOver the past 25 years, there have been signi\ufb01-\ncant improvements in the 5-year relative sur-\nvival rate for many childhood cancers (Table 15).\nThe 5-year relative survival rate among children\nfor all cancer sites combined improved from 58%\nfor patients diagnosed in 1975 to 1977 to 79%\nfor those diagnosed in 1996 to 2002.3\n70 and\nBirth to\nBirth to 39\n40 to 59\n60 to 69\nOlder\nDeath\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\nAll sites\u2020\nMale\n1.42 (1 in 70)\n8.69 (1 in 12)\n16.58 (1 in 6)\n39.44 (1 in 3)\n45.31 (1 in 2)\nFemale\n2.03 (1 in 49)\n9.09 (1 in 11)\n10.57 (1 in 9)\n26.60 (1 in 4)\n37.86 (1 in 3)\nUrinary bladder\nMale\n.02 (1 in 4381)\n.41 (1 in 241)\n.96 (1 in 105)\n3.41 (1 in 29)\n3.61 (1 in 28)\nFemale\n.01 (1 in 9527)\n.13 (1 in 782)\n.26 (1 in 379)\n.96 (1 in 105)\n1.14 (1 in 87)\nBreast\nFemale\n.48 (1 in 210)\n3.98 (1 in 25)\n3.65 (1 in 27)\n6.84 (1 in 15)\n12.67 (1 in 8)\nColon & rectum\nMale\n.07 (1 in 1342)\n.93 (1 in 107)\n1.67 (1 in 60)\n4.92 (1 in 20)\n5.79 (1 in 17)\nFemale\n.07 (1 in 1469)\n.73 (1 in 138)\n1.16 (1 in 86)\n4.45 (1 in 22)\n5.37 (1 in 19)\nLeukemia\nMale\n.16 (1 in 640)\n.22 (1 in 452)\n.35 (1 in 286)\n1.17 (1 in 86)\n1.49 (1 in 67)\nFemale\n.12 (1 in 820)\n.14 (1 in 694)\n.20 (1 in 491)\n.75 (1 in 132)\n1.05 (1 in 95)\nLung & bronchus\nMale\n.03 (1 in 3146)\n1.09 (1 in 92)\n2.61 (1 in 38)\n6.76 (1 in 15)\n8.02 (1 in 12)\nFemale\n.04 (1 in 2779)\n.85 (1 in 117)\n1.84 (1 in 54)\n4.52 (1 in 22)\n6.15 (1 in 16)\nMelanoma of the skin\nMale\n.13 (1 in 775)\n.53 (1 in 187)\n.56 (1 in 178)\n1.32 (1 in 76)\n2.04 (1 in 49)\nFemale\n.21 (1 in 467)\n.42 (1 in 237)\n.29 (1 in 347)\n.62 (1 in 163)\n1.38 (1 in 73)\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nMale\n.14 (1 in 735)\n.45 (1 in 222)\n.57 (1 in 176)\n1.56 (1 in 64)\n2.14 (1 in 47)\nFemale\n.08 (1 in 1200)\n.32 (1 in 313)\n.44 (1 in 229)\n1.30 (1 in 77)\n1.83 (1 in 55)\nProstate\nMale\n.01 (1 in 10373)\n2.59 (1 in 39)\n7.03 (1 in 14)\n13.83 (1 in 7)\n17.12 (1 in 6)\nUterine cervix\nFemale\n.16 (1 in 631)\n.29 (1 in 346)\n.14 (1 in 695)\n.20 (1 in 512)\n.73 (1 in 138)\nUterine corpus\nFemale\n.06 (1 in 1652)\n.70 (1 in 142)\n.81 (1 in 124)\n1.28 (1 in 78)\n2.49 (1 in 40)\n*For those free of cancer at beginning of age interval.

These estimates may vary con-\nsiderably from year to year, particularly for less\ncommon cancers and in states with smaller pop-\nulations. Unanticipated changes may occur that\nare not captured by modeling techniques.\nEstimates are also affected by changes in method.\nThe introduction of a new method for estimat-\ning new cancer cases in 2007 has substantially\naffected the estimates for a number of cancers,\nparticularly leukemia and female breast (see Pickle\net al for more detailed discussion).12 For these\nreasons, we discourage the use of these estimates\nto track year-to-year changes in cancer occurrence\nand death. Age-standardized or age-speci\ufb01c can-\ncer death rates from the NCHS and cancer inci-\ndence rates from SEER or NPCR are the\npreferred data sources for tracking cancer trends,\neven though these data are 3 and 4 years old,\nrespectively, by the time that they become avail-\nable. Despite their limitations, the ACS estimates\nof the number of new cancer cases and deaths\nin the current year provide reasonably accurate\nestimates of the burden of new cancer cases and\ndeaths in the United States. Such estimates will\nassist in continuing efforts to reduce the public\nhealth burden of cancer.\nREFERENCES\n1.

To introduce a multidisciplinary approach for the management of COVID-19-infected \npatients and to report the first operated patient in the Corona unit.\nMethods\u2002 A detailed presentation of the hospital plan for a separate Corona unit with its intensive care unit and operating \nrooms. Description of the management of the first spine surgery case treated in this unit.\nResults\u2002 The Corona unit showed a practical approach for the management of an emergency cervical spine fracture-dislocation \nwith acute paralysis. The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the \ninternal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room. Education of the medical staff and organiza-\ntion of the operating theatre facilitated the management of the patient without an increased risk of spreading the infection.\nConclusions\u2002 The current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary organization of the medical and surgical care of \nthe patients. It is possible to manage an infected or a potentially infected patient surgically, but a multidisciplinary plan is \nnecessary to protect other patients and the medical staff.\nKeywords\u2002 COVID-19\u00a0\u00b7 Emergency\u00a0\u00b7 Cervical fracture\u00a0\u00b7 Corona ward\u00a0\u00b7 Surgical planning\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nIn late 2019, a series of severe acute respiratory syndrome \n(SARS) was reported in China. The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms. Protective masks (FFP3 filtering facepiece particle \nFig.\u202f2\u2002 \u2009A 92-year-old female patient presenting with fracture-dislocation C6-7. Sagittal CT a, facet joint dislocation on the right side b, facet \njoint dislocation on the left side c, MRI examination d and postoperative X-ray showing reduction and fixation e\u200a\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n472\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\n3), head covers and eye goggles are adequately stocked in the \noperating rooms. The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation. Surgical team (a), anaesthesia team (b) and the operating room equipment (c)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n473\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\nthe neurological status was recorded (ASIA B). On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions.

We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.

These charts enable physicians to compare the \ngrowth of an individual with that of the general population, assessing whether the individual \nhas growth failure or not. Starting with such assessment, a physician can investigate a specific \ndiagnosis for an individual with growth failure, although the diagnosis is usually determined \nby other findings such as clinical features, hormone levels, karyotyping, or bone radiographs.\nMany congenital diseases are associated with growth failure, and patients with these diseases \nshow characteristic growth patterns. As the growth patterns of affected individuals differ \nfrom those of the normal population, it is challenging to detect additional conditions that \ninfluence their growth using growth charts for the normal population. In clinical settings, it is \nessential for physicians to consider other possible contributory factors besides the established \ndiagnosis. To that end, disease-specific growth charts are very useful and are necessary for \nseveral reasons\n3). First, they are helpful for understanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis \nof a disease. Second, they enable the detection of deviations from typical growth patterns in \n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n241\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\naffected individuals and aid in early diagnosis of additional \nconditions. Finally, they are very useful for evaluating the \neffects of growth-promoting treatment among patients. At \npresent, disease-specific growth charts are available for several \nsyndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, \nWilliams syndrome, Turner syndrome (TS), and Noonan \nsyndrome (NS)\n4-10).\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, we should \nconsider several factors that may affect the reliability of the \ncharts (Table 1). First, we should determine if the disease with \ngrowth failure can be precisely defined. If the pathogenesis \nor etiology of the disease is ambiguous, we cannot admit the \nsignificance of disease-specific growth charts. Second, we should \navoid selection bias in subject measurements whenever possible. \nIt often occurs that subjects recruited for measurements are not \nrepresentative of the overall disease population, as diagnoses \nare usually made after many symptoms manifest. Therefore, it \nis possible that the sample used for measurements is biased by \ndelayed diagnosis of the disease, and if we analyzed only cross-\nsectional data, the developed disease-specific growth charts \nmay show biased and different growth patterns. This will be \ndiscussed later in the example on the development of growth \ncharts in TS. Additional selection bias may derive from the \nspecialties of the physicians seeing the patients, which will be \ndiscussed later in the example of the development of growth \ncharts in NS. Briefly, in clinically heterogeneous disease such \nas NS where many specialists are involved in care, subject \nmeasurements should be obtained from multidisciplinary \nspecialists. In addition, the rearing environment of the subjects \nmay cause selection bias. Third, we should consider secular \ntrends among subjects when gathering data. For rare diseases, \nit can be difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients. \nTherefore, we tend to recruit subjects over many years, which \ncan cause the developed disease-specific growth charts to be \naffected by secular growth trends. Fourth, we should collect \nmeasurements from a sufficient number of patients of all ages \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. If insufficient \nsubjects are available in certain age categories, a bump or a \ndip will be observed in the growth charts, which reflects the \nsampling error that occurs with a small number of subjects. \nFifth, we should consider that ethnicity can influence the \ngrowth of children with a disease. Finally, we should analyze \nprecise anthropometric data using proper statistical methods. \nConsidering all these factors, it seems almost impossible to \ncollect ideal data to establish true disease-specific standards. \nHowever, is it necessary to do so because disease-specific growth \nreferences remain meaningful tools for physicians in various \nclinical settings\n3). In this review, we summarize our experiences \ndeveloping disease-specific growth charts in TS\n8) and NS\n9,10).\nDevelopment of growth charts in TS\nTS is a chromosomal disorder occurring in females that is \ncharacterized by short stature and primary ovarian failure. It is \nthe most common chromosomal disorder in females, and the \nincidence is estimated at 1 in 1,500\u20132,500 live births\n11-13). TS is \ndefined by a karyotype that contains a cell line of monosomy \nlacking at least the distal major part of the short arm of one X \nchromosome. The growth patterns of TS girls are different from \nthose of normal individuals\n11-13). The birth length in TS is smaller \nthan that in normal populations due to mild growth delay in \nutero. After birth, the growth velocity gradually declines. The \nlength/height of girls with TS often remains within the normal \nrange during infancy, but usually falls below the fifth percentile \nof the normal population by the age of 5 years. Growth failure is \nmore evident as girls become mature, and growth spurts are not \nobserved during the expected pubertal period. Untreated adults \nwith TS are reported to be approximately 20 cm shorter than \nnormal female adults\n14).\nTS-specific growth charts are available in many coun\u00ad\ntries\n8,15-23). In Japan, the first TS-specific growth charts were \ndeveloped by Suwa\n20) in 1992. These charts were constructed \nusing data from 704 girls with TS (6,255 measurements) born \nfrom 1955 to 1989 (median unknown), meaning that most of \nthe analyzed subjects were born in 1972 or earlier. As the secular \ntrend of increasing height among Japanese children reached a \nplateau around 1990\n7), the TS-specific growth charts developed \nby Suwa\n20) became inappropriate for the evaluation of girls \nrecently diagnosed with TS. Thus, revisions to the charts were \nnecessary.\nFor the development of revised TS-specific growth charts, we \nutilized a database from the Foundation for Growth Science\n24). \nThis database controls for the use of growth hormone (GH) \nthrough its registration system and contains pretreatment data \nfor TS patients across Japan. After data cleaning and analyzing \npretreatment data for girls with TS born in 1970 or later, cross-\nsectional growth charts were constructed\n7). However, there was \na problem that the growth charts were shifted downward in \nyounger ages, which seemed to be due to selection bias. Girls \nwith TS who registered with the Foundation during infancy \ntended to be smaller than those who registered beyond infancy, \nbecause the degree of height difference between girls with TS \nand the normal population was smaller in infancy. On the other \nhand, girls with TS who registered at older ages might not have \nbeen affected by this selection bias because the height difference \nTable 1.

In brief, taller \nTS patients are often diagnosed only in older ages. To solve \nthis problem, data for relatively tall TS girls during infancy was \nneeded. To address this issue, we utilized semilongitudinal data \nfor girls with TS diagnosed at older ages. As the Foundation \ndatabase only included 3 consecutive years of data prior to GH \ntreatment, we could not obtain enough data from this source. \nTherefore, we collected new longitudinal data from the medical \nrecords of 205 girls with TS who sought treatment at 2 major \nhospitals in Tokyo (the National Center for Child Health and \nDevelopment and Toranomon Hospital) and used these data \nfor the revision of the growth charts. From the 2 datasets, 2,072 \nsubjects (born from 1970 to 2006, median 1985) were available. \nAfter excluding individuals who lacked the typical TS karyotype \n(n=31), those with spontaneous puberty (n=144), unknown \npuberty at the time of height and weight measurement (n=14), \na history of growth-promoting treatment (n=264), measured \nvalues exceeding \u00b15 standard deviation (SD) in the study \npopulation (n=4), and duplicate registration (n=50), 1,565 \nsubjects were retained for analysis. The presence of puberty was \njudged by statements in the application form (for Foundation \ndata) or the attainment of Tanner 2 breast development \n(for hospital data). Of the 5,796 measurements from 1,565 \nsubjects before growth-promoting treatment, an additional \n24 measurements were excluded because they fell outside \nthe range of \u00b15 SD of the population mean. New TS-specific \ngrowth charts were then constructed from the remaining 5,772 \nmeasurements using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nBased on the new TS-specific growth chart, the mean height \nof an adult female with TS is 141.3\u00b15.6 cm, which is comparable \nto data from other Japanese TS samples (e.g., 143.0\u00b14.9 cm, 18 \nTS females without GH treatment)\n26). According to the chart, \nindividuals with TS at the age of 20 years are, on average, -3.30 \nSD below the mean height for the normal population, which \nis similar to data from foreign countries (-2.54 to -4.15 SD)\n14). \nThese findings support the validity of the new TS-specific \ngrowth chart.\nGirls with TS with spontaneous puberty are significantly \ntaller than those without spontaneous puberty at the age of \n\u226512 years, but the difference is no longer significant when \nthey reach their adult height\n22). Thus, 2 types of growth charts \nmay be necessary during the peripubertal period. However, \nwe only produced TS-specific growth charts for girls without \nspontaneous puberty due to the limited number of pubertal \nsubjects. Nevertheless, when we plotted the measurements from \n144 subjects with spontaneous puberty on the new charts, all \nexcept for 5 measurements were distributed within \u00b12 SD. This \nfinding suggests that the new TS-specific growth charts can be \nused for girls with TS with spontaneous puberty.\nThrough these processes, new TS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese girls were constructed\n8). We believe that the new TS-\nspecific charts can be presumed to be representative of growth \nin girls with TS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practices. In \naddition, these charts are the only TS-specific growth charts \nbased on an Asian population.\nDevelopment of growth charts in NS\nNS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome \nwith an estimated incidence of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 \nlive births\n27-29). The cardinal features of NS are distinctive facial \ncharacteristics that change with age, short stature, congenital \nheart disease, and chest deformity\n27,30). Clinical features of NS \ncan vary within a family, but become more subtle in adult life\n31). \nIndividuals with NS are typically treated by a multidisciplinary \nteam of specialists, which includes pediatric geneticists, \npediatric cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists.\nThe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling \npathway is an essential signaling pathway that controls cell \nproliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein-\ntyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene, \nwhich encodes a tyrosine phosphatase protein involved in \nthe Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, was identified as the first \ncausative gene in NS patients\n32). Increasing evidence indicates \nthat germline mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK \nsignaling pathway cause NS and Noonan-related syndrome\n33). \nWhile mutations in such genes have been identified in \napproximately 60%\u201370% of patients with NS\n34,35), the diagnosis \nof NS remains clinical\n27,36). Several scoring systems are currently \navailable for diagnosis, with the scoring system developed by \nvan der Burgt et al.\n37) in 1994 being the most widely used.\nGrowth patterns of children with NS are different from \nthose of the normal population. The mean birth length is \nslightly shorter, but within the normal range. However, a rapid \ndecline in length/height SD score (SDS) relative to the normal \npopulation develops during the first year of life. Thereafter, \nmean length/height lies approximately on the -2.5 SD line for \nthe normal population until age 12 years in boys and 10.5 years \nin girls. Afterwards, further decline becomes obvious due to \ndelayed puberty, and then the height SDS relative to the normal \npopulation tends to recover.\nNS-specific growth curves are currently available for 4 regions: \nBrazil, Europe, North America, and Japan\n9,10,38-40). Undoubtedly, \nNS-specific charts should be developed with data collected by \nmultidisciplinary specialists. Therefore, when we constructed \nNS-specific growth charts\n9,10), we conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of pediatric geneticists, pediatric cardiologists, and \npediatric endocrinologists responsible for Japanese NS patients. \nWe collaborated with three academic societies (i.e., The Japan \nSociety of Pediatric Genetics, The Japanese Society of Pediatric \nCardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and The Japanese Society for \nPediatric Endocrinology) and gathered data for NS patients \ndiagnosed by specialists from these societies at 31 hospitals \nnationwide. Due to secular trends in height, we recruited \npatients born in 1970 or later\n7). Questionnaires that included \nauxological measurements together with a minimal set of \nclinical and genetic data were sent to these hospitals. Height and \nweight measurements were gathered in a mixed longitudinal \nand cross-sectional manner. The minimal interval between 2 \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n243\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\nmeasurements was 1 month when the subjects were measured \nbefore 1 year of age or 3 months when measured after 1 year of \nage.\nTwenty of the 31 hospitals responded to our questionnaire, \nresulting in data for 356 clinically diagnosed NS patients. A total \nof 48 subjects were excluded because of missing auxological \ndata (n=26), presence of complications that might have affected \ngrowth (n=5), or extreme longitudinal growth aberrations \u00b13 \nSD from the mean (n=17). The remaining 308 subjects (159 \nboys, 149 girls) were analyzed. To develop the growth charts, \n3,249 measurements (boys, 1,674; girls, 1,575) were included \nafter exclusion of 23 measurements from three outliers. Height \nSDSs were not significantly different between individuals with \nand without genetic analysis (difference, 0.076; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.020 to 0.17; P=0.12). NS-specific growth charts \nwere constructed using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nSubjects were diagnosed with NS by certified specialists, \nand thus, diagnoses were very reliable. Moreover, diagnosis \nwas further validated by the scoring system developed by van \nder Burgt et al.\n37). All measurements were properly selected \nby excluding individuals with previous growth-promoting \ntreatment, complications that may affect growth, and extreme \nlongitudinal growth aberrations. Based on the NS-specific \ngrowth charts, adult height is 157.3\u00b17.4 cm for males (-2.3\u00b11.3 \nSDS) and 146.8\u00b16.9 cm for females (-2.1\u00b11.3 SDS). These adult \nheight SDSs for the normal population are comparable to values \nreported in other countries (male, -2.5 to -1.4; female, -2.2 to \n-1.8)\n38-42).\nThrough these processes, NS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese individuals were constructed\n9,10). We believe that \nthese charts can be presumed to be representative of growth in \nindividuals with NS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practice. \nMoreover, these are the only NS-specific growth charts based on \nmeasurements from an Asian population.\nStatistical method used for developing \ngrowth charts\nThe lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method\n43) was used for the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese \nindividuals with TS and NS. The LMS method is a standard \nmethod for establishing growth charts\n44) and is effective at \nconstructing reference charts that show the distribution of \na measurement as it changes by covariates such as age and \ntime. The LMS method includes smoothing with a spline \nfunction after normalizing age-specific data using a power \ntransformation. In this method, the degree of skewness (L), \nmedian (M), and coefficient of variation (S) are estimated by \nage, and SD scores (Z-scores) of each index can be calculated \nfrom the L, M, and S values. This method also allows the \ncalculation of percentiles, as SD scores can be converted to \npercentiles in a normal distribution. The LMS method is usually \nused for establishing growth charts based on cross-sectional \ndata. However, it can also be used for establishing growth \ncharts based on longitudinal data when the measurements are \nwidely scattered and there are no subjects with a nonnegligible \ninfluence on the charts\n9,45). In the data used for development of \ndisease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with TS \nand NS, numerous measurements were scattered across the age \nrange and all subjects had a significant influence on the growth \ncharts.\nDiscussion\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, it is essential \nto collect anthropometric measurements that reflect the true \ndisease population. Therefore, we made maximal efforts to \nobtain unbiased data for subjects with TS and NS that were \nrepresentative of overall TS and NS populations in Japan. Table \n2 summarizes the characteristics considered in the development \nof disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with \nTS and NS. For TS, we first utilized an existing nationwide \ncohort of TS patients before GH treatment in Japan. However, \nthis cohort did not represent the true population of TS due \nto diagnosis bias. To overcome this significant selection bias, \nwe compiled new hospital data in addition to the cohort data \nand analyzed both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. \nThese efforts have made the TS-specific charts closer to the \ntrue TS standards. For NS, there was not an existing cohort with \nanthropometric data. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide \nquestionnaire survey of multidisciplinary specialists, as NS is a \nclinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. As diagnosis \nof NS can be difficult, it was essential to have reliable diagnoses. \nTo do so, we only compiled data for subjects diagnosed by \ncertified specialists and validated the diagnosis using the \nscoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.\n37). Although \nthese efforts may not be perfect, we believe that the collected \nTable 2.

As the population of Japan is generally considered \nethnically homogeneous, we did not need to consider ethnicity \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. Theoretically, \nlocal TS and NS-specific growth charts would be most suitable \nfor individual growth monitoring in different countries. \nHowever, developing these charts can be difficult. It is of note \nthat there are no other disease-specific growth charts in TS and \nNS for Asian populations except for our charts. If our charts \nare used for other Asian populations, physicians should bear in \nmind how growth patterns in their countries differ from those \nin Japanese. For example, if our charts were utilized by Korean \nphysicians, they should know the difference in growth patterns \nbetween the two countries. Fig. 1 shows growth charts of the \nnormal Japanese population\n46) superimposed on the normal \nKorean population\n47). As the figure shows, there is considerable \noverlap except for younger and pubertal ages. Therefore, our TS \nand NS-specific growth charts might be applicable as long as \nphysicians are aware of the different growth patterns between \ntwo countries in the general population.\nConclusions\nDisease-specific growth charts are very useful tools. Theoreti\u00ad\ncally, these charts should be constructed for each ethnic group. \nHowever, gathering unbiased subject measurements is very \nchallenging. Here, we reviewed the development of disease-\nspecific charts for Japanese individuals with TS and NS. When \nusing disease-specific charts developed using data from other \nethnic groups, physicians should consider the underlying \ndifferences in normal growth patterns between ethnic groups.\nConflict of interest\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was \nreported.\nReferences \n1.\t\nHermanussen M.

As the growth patterns of affected \nindividuals differ from those of normal populations, it is challenging to detect \nadditional conditions that can influence growth using standard growth charts. \nDisease-specific growth charts are thus very useful tools and can be helpful for \nunderstanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis of congenital diseases. In \naddition, disease-specific growth charts allow doctors to detect deviations from \nthe usual growth patterns for early diagnosis of an additional condition and can \nbe used to evaluate the effects of growth-promoting treatment for patients. When \ndeveloping these charts, factors that can affect the reliability of the charts should \nbe considered. These factors include the definition of the disease with growth \nfailure, selection bias in the measurements used to develop the charts, secular \ntrends of the subjects, the numbers of subjects of varying ages and ethnicities, and \nthe statistical method used to develop the charts. In this review, we summarize the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with Turner \nsyndrome and Noonan syndrome and evaluate the efforts to collect unbiased \nmeasurements of subjects with these diseases. These charts were the only available \ndisease-specific growth charts of Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome for Asian \npopulations and were developed using a Japanese population. Therefore, when \nthese charts are adopted for Asian populations other than Japanese, different \ngrowth patterns should be considered. \nKeywords: Growth charts, Disease-specific growth chart, Turner syndrome, Noonan \nsyndrome, LMS method, Asian population\nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\n1,\nSusumu Yokoya, MD, PhD\n2\n1Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, \nTokyo, \n2Fukushima Global Medical \nScience Center, Fukushima Medical \nUniversity, Fukushima, Japan\nhttps://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.4.240\nAnn Pediatr Endocrinol Metab 2017;22:240-246\n\u00a92017 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism\nReceived: 12 December, 2017\nAccepted: 18 December, 2017\nAddress for correspondence: \nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, 2-11-\n1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-8606, \nJapan\nTel: +81-3-3964-1211\nFax: +81-3-3579-8212\nE-mail: isojimat-tky@umin.ac.jp\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-0011-\n0325\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nISSN: 2287-1012(Print) \nISSN: 2287-1292(Online) \nIntroduction\nGrowth charts are vital tools used worldwide for evaluating the growth of children in clinical \nsettings as well as public health examinations\n1,2). These charts enable physicians to compare the \ngrowth of an individual with that of the general population, assessing whether the individual \nhas growth failure or not. Starting with such assessment, a physician can investigate a specific \ndiagnosis for an individual with growth failure, although the diagnosis is usually determined \nby other findings such as clinical features, hormone levels, karyotyping, or bone radiographs.\nMany congenital diseases are associated with growth failure, and patients with these diseases \nshow characteristic growth patterns. As the growth patterns of affected individuals differ \nfrom those of the normal population, it is challenging to detect additional conditions that \ninfluence their growth using growth charts for the normal population. In clinical settings, it is \nessential for physicians to consider other possible contributory factors besides the established \ndiagnosis. To that end, disease-specific growth charts are very useful and are necessary for \nseveral reasons\n3). First, they are helpful for understanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis \nof a disease. Second, they enable the detection of deviations from typical growth patterns in \n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n241\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\naffected individuals and aid in early diagnosis of additional \nconditions. Finally, they are very useful for evaluating the \neffects of growth-promoting treatment among patients. At \npresent, disease-specific growth charts are available for several \nsyndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, \nWilliams syndrome, Turner syndrome (TS), and Noonan \nsyndrome (NS)\n4-10).\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, we should \nconsider several factors that may affect the reliability of the \ncharts (Table 1). First, we should determine if the disease with \ngrowth failure can be precisely defined. If the pathogenesis \nor etiology of the disease is ambiguous, we cannot admit the \nsignificance of disease-specific growth charts. Second, we should \navoid selection bias in subject measurements whenever possible. \nIt often occurs that subjects recruited for measurements are not \nrepresentative of the overall disease population, as diagnoses \nare usually made after many symptoms manifest. Therefore, it \nis possible that the sample used for measurements is biased by \ndelayed diagnosis of the disease, and if we analyzed only cross-\nsectional data, the developed disease-specific growth charts \nmay show biased and different growth patterns. This will be \ndiscussed later in the example on the development of growth \ncharts in TS. Additional selection bias may derive from the \nspecialties of the physicians seeing the patients, which will be \ndiscussed later in the example of the development of growth \ncharts in NS. Briefly, in clinically heterogeneous disease such \nas NS where many specialists are involved in care, subject \nmeasurements should be obtained from multidisciplinary \nspecialists. In addition, the rearing environment of the subjects \nmay cause selection bias. Third, we should consider secular \ntrends among subjects when gathering data. For rare diseases, \nit can be difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients. \nTherefore, we tend to recruit subjects over many years, which \ncan cause the developed disease-specific growth charts to be \naffected by secular growth trends. Fourth, we should collect \nmeasurements from a sufficient number of patients of all ages \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. If insufficient \nsubjects are available in certain age categories, a bump or a \ndip will be observed in the growth charts, which reflects the \nsampling error that occurs with a small number of subjects. \nFifth, we should consider that ethnicity can influence the \ngrowth of children with a disease. Finally, we should analyze \nprecise anthropometric data using proper statistical methods. \nConsidering all these factors, it seems almost impossible to \ncollect ideal data to establish true disease-specific standards. \nHowever, is it necessary to do so because disease-specific growth \nreferences remain meaningful tools for physicians in various \nclinical settings\n3). In this review, we summarize our experiences \ndeveloping disease-specific growth charts in TS\n8) and NS\n9,10).\nDevelopment of growth charts in TS\nTS is a chromosomal disorder occurring in females that is \ncharacterized by short stature and primary ovarian failure. It is \nthe most common chromosomal disorder in females, and the \nincidence is estimated at 1 in 1,500\u20132,500 live births\n11-13). TS is \ndefined by a karyotype that contains a cell line of monosomy \nlacking at least the distal major part of the short arm of one X \nchromosome. The growth patterns of TS girls are different from \nthose of normal individuals\n11-13). The birth length in TS is smaller \nthan that in normal populations due to mild growth delay in \nutero. After birth, the growth velocity gradually declines. The \nlength/height of girls with TS often remains within the normal \nrange during infancy, but usually falls below the fifth percentile \nof the normal population by the age of 5 years. Growth failure is \nmore evident as girls become mature, and growth spurts are not \nobserved during the expected pubertal period. Untreated adults \nwith TS are reported to be approximately 20 cm shorter than \nnormal female adults\n14).\nTS-specific growth charts are available in many coun\u00ad\ntries\n8,15-23). In Japan, the first TS-specific growth charts were \ndeveloped by Suwa\n20) in 1992. These charts were constructed \nusing data from 704 girls with TS (6,255 measurements) born \nfrom 1955 to 1989 (median unknown), meaning that most of \nthe analyzed subjects were born in 1972 or earlier. As the secular \ntrend of increasing height among Japanese children reached a \nplateau around 1990\n7), the TS-specific growth charts developed \nby Suwa\n20) became inappropriate for the evaluation of girls \nrecently diagnosed with TS. Thus, revisions to the charts were \nnecessary.\nFor the development of revised TS-specific growth charts, we \nutilized a database from the Foundation for Growth Science\n24). \nThis database controls for the use of growth hormone (GH) \nthrough its registration system and contains pretreatment data \nfor TS patients across Japan. After data cleaning and analyzing \npretreatment data for girls with TS born in 1970 or later, cross-\nsectional growth charts were constructed\n7). However, there was \na problem that the growth charts were shifted downward in \nyounger ages, which seemed to be due to selection bias. Girls \nwith TS who registered with the Foundation during infancy \ntended to be smaller than those who registered beyond infancy, \nbecause the degree of height difference between girls with TS \nand the normal population was smaller in infancy. On the other \nhand, girls with TS who registered at older ages might not have \nbeen affected by this selection bias because the height difference \nTable 1.

In brief, taller \nTS patients are often diagnosed only in older ages. To solve \nthis problem, data for relatively tall TS girls during infancy was \nneeded. To address this issue, we utilized semilongitudinal data \nfor girls with TS diagnosed at older ages. As the Foundation \ndatabase only included 3 consecutive years of data prior to GH \ntreatment, we could not obtain enough data from this source. \nTherefore, we collected new longitudinal data from the medical \nrecords of 205 girls with TS who sought treatment at 2 major \nhospitals in Tokyo (the National Center for Child Health and \nDevelopment and Toranomon Hospital) and used these data \nfor the revision of the growth charts. From the 2 datasets, 2,072 \nsubjects (born from 1970 to 2006, median 1985) were available. \nAfter excluding individuals who lacked the typical TS karyotype \n(n=31), those with spontaneous puberty (n=144), unknown \npuberty at the time of height and weight measurement (n=14), \na history of growth-promoting treatment (n=264), measured \nvalues exceeding \u00b15 standard deviation (SD) in the study \npopulation (n=4), and duplicate registration (n=50), 1,565 \nsubjects were retained for analysis. The presence of puberty was \njudged by statements in the application form (for Foundation \ndata) or the attainment of Tanner 2 breast development \n(for hospital data). Of the 5,796 measurements from 1,565 \nsubjects before growth-promoting treatment, an additional \n24 measurements were excluded because they fell outside \nthe range of \u00b15 SD of the population mean. New TS-specific \ngrowth charts were then constructed from the remaining 5,772 \nmeasurements using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nBased on the new TS-specific growth chart, the mean height \nof an adult female with TS is 141.3\u00b15.6 cm, which is comparable \nto data from other Japanese TS samples (e.g., 143.0\u00b14.9 cm, 18 \nTS females without GH treatment)\n26). According to the chart, \nindividuals with TS at the age of 20 years are, on average, -3.30 \nSD below the mean height for the normal population, which \nis similar to data from foreign countries (-2.54 to -4.15 SD)\n14). \nThese findings support the validity of the new TS-specific \ngrowth chart.\nGirls with TS with spontaneous puberty are significantly \ntaller than those without spontaneous puberty at the age of \n\u226512 years, but the difference is no longer significant when \nthey reach their adult height\n22). Thus, 2 types of growth charts \nmay be necessary during the peripubertal period. However, \nwe only produced TS-specific growth charts for girls without \nspontaneous puberty due to the limited number of pubertal \nsubjects. Nevertheless, when we plotted the measurements from \n144 subjects with spontaneous puberty on the new charts, all \nexcept for 5 measurements were distributed within \u00b12 SD. This \nfinding suggests that the new TS-specific growth charts can be \nused for girls with TS with spontaneous puberty.\nThrough these processes, new TS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese girls were constructed\n8). We believe that the new TS-\nspecific charts can be presumed to be representative of growth \nin girls with TS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practices. In \naddition, these charts are the only TS-specific growth charts \nbased on an Asian population.\nDevelopment of growth charts in NS\nNS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome \nwith an estimated incidence of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 \nlive births\n27-29). The cardinal features of NS are distinctive facial \ncharacteristics that change with age, short stature, congenital \nheart disease, and chest deformity\n27,30). Clinical features of NS \ncan vary within a family, but become more subtle in adult life\n31). \nIndividuals with NS are typically treated by a multidisciplinary \nteam of specialists, which includes pediatric geneticists, \npediatric cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists.\nThe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling \npathway is an essential signaling pathway that controls cell \nproliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein-\ntyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene, \nwhich encodes a tyrosine phosphatase protein involved in \nthe Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, was identified as the first \ncausative gene in NS patients\n32). Increasing evidence indicates \nthat germline mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK \nsignaling pathway cause NS and Noonan-related syndrome\n33). \nWhile mutations in such genes have been identified in \napproximately 60%\u201370% of patients with NS\n34,35), the diagnosis \nof NS remains clinical\n27,36). Several scoring systems are currently \navailable for diagnosis, with the scoring system developed by \nvan der Burgt et al.\n37) in 1994 being the most widely used.\nGrowth patterns of children with NS are different from \nthose of the normal population. The mean birth length is \nslightly shorter, but within the normal range. However, a rapid \ndecline in length/height SD score (SDS) relative to the normal \npopulation develops during the first year of life. Thereafter, \nmean length/height lies approximately on the -2.5 SD line for \nthe normal population until age 12 years in boys and 10.5 years \nin girls. Afterwards, further decline becomes obvious due to \ndelayed puberty, and then the height SDS relative to the normal \npopulation tends to recover.\nNS-specific growth curves are currently available for 4 regions: \nBrazil, Europe, North America, and Japan\n9,10,38-40). Undoubtedly, \nNS-specific charts should be developed with data collected by \nmultidisciplinary specialists. Therefore, when we constructed \nNS-specific growth charts\n9,10), we conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of pediatric geneticists, pediatric cardiologists, and \npediatric endocrinologists responsible for Japanese NS patients. \nWe collaborated with three academic societies (i.e., The Japan \nSociety of Pediatric Genetics, The Japanese Society of Pediatric \nCardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and The Japanese Society for \nPediatric Endocrinology) and gathered data for NS patients \ndiagnosed by specialists from these societies at 31 hospitals \nnationwide. Due to secular trends in height, we recruited \npatients born in 1970 or later\n7). Questionnaires that included \nauxological measurements together with a minimal set of \nclinical and genetic data were sent to these hospitals. Height and \nweight measurements were gathered in a mixed longitudinal \nand cross-sectional manner. The minimal interval between 2 \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n243\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\nmeasurements was 1 month when the subjects were measured \nbefore 1 year of age or 3 months when measured after 1 year of \nage.\nTwenty of the 31 hospitals responded to our questionnaire, \nresulting in data for 356 clinically diagnosed NS patients. A total \nof 48 subjects were excluded because of missing auxological \ndata (n=26), presence of complications that might have affected \ngrowth (n=5), or extreme longitudinal growth aberrations \u00b13 \nSD from the mean (n=17). The remaining 308 subjects (159 \nboys, 149 girls) were analyzed. To develop the growth charts, \n3,249 measurements (boys, 1,674; girls, 1,575) were included \nafter exclusion of 23 measurements from three outliers. Height \nSDSs were not significantly different between individuals with \nand without genetic analysis (difference, 0.076; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.020 to 0.17; P=0.12). NS-specific growth charts \nwere constructed using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nSubjects were diagnosed with NS by certified specialists, \nand thus, diagnoses were very reliable. Moreover, diagnosis \nwas further validated by the scoring system developed by van \nder Burgt et al.\n37). All measurements were properly selected \nby excluding individuals with previous growth-promoting \ntreatment, complications that may affect growth, and extreme \nlongitudinal growth aberrations. Based on the NS-specific \ngrowth charts, adult height is 157.3\u00b17.4 cm for males (-2.3\u00b11.3 \nSDS) and 146.8\u00b16.9 cm for females (-2.1\u00b11.3 SDS). These adult \nheight SDSs for the normal population are comparable to values \nreported in other countries (male, -2.5 to -1.4; female, -2.2 to \n-1.8)\n38-42).\nThrough these processes, NS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese individuals were constructed\n9,10). We believe that \nthese charts can be presumed to be representative of growth in \nindividuals with NS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practice. \nMoreover, these are the only NS-specific growth charts based on \nmeasurements from an Asian population.\nStatistical method used for developing \ngrowth charts\nThe lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method\n43) was used for the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese \nindividuals with TS and NS. The LMS method is a standard \nmethod for establishing growth charts\n44) and is effective at \nconstructing reference charts that show the distribution of \na measurement as it changes by covariates such as age and \ntime. The LMS method includes smoothing with a spline \nfunction after normalizing age-specific data using a power \ntransformation. In this method, the degree of skewness (L), \nmedian (M), and coefficient of variation (S) are estimated by \nage, and SD scores (Z-scores) of each index can be calculated \nfrom the L, M, and S values. This method also allows the \ncalculation of percentiles, as SD scores can be converted to \npercentiles in a normal distribution. The LMS method is usually \nused for establishing growth charts based on cross-sectional \ndata. However, it can also be used for establishing growth \ncharts based on longitudinal data when the measurements are \nwidely scattered and there are no subjects with a nonnegligible \ninfluence on the charts\n9,45). In the data used for development of \ndisease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with TS \nand NS, numerous measurements were scattered across the age \nrange and all subjects had a significant influence on the growth \ncharts.\nDiscussion\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, it is essential \nto collect anthropometric measurements that reflect the true \ndisease population. Therefore, we made maximal efforts to \nobtain unbiased data for subjects with TS and NS that were \nrepresentative of overall TS and NS populations in Japan. Table \n2 summarizes the characteristics considered in the development \nof disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with \nTS and NS. For TS, we first utilized an existing nationwide \ncohort of TS patients before GH treatment in Japan. However, \nthis cohort did not represent the true population of TS due \nto diagnosis bias. To overcome this significant selection bias, \nwe compiled new hospital data in addition to the cohort data \nand analyzed both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. \nThese efforts have made the TS-specific charts closer to the \ntrue TS standards. For NS, there was not an existing cohort with \nanthropometric data. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide \nquestionnaire survey of multidisciplinary specialists, as NS is a \nclinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. As diagnosis \nof NS can be difficult, it was essential to have reliable diagnoses. \nTo do so, we only compiled data for subjects diagnosed by \ncertified specialists and validated the diagnosis using the \nscoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.\n37). Although \nthese efforts may not be perfect, we believe that the collected \nTable 2.

As the population of Japan is generally considered \nethnically homogeneous, we did not need to consider ethnicity \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. Theoretically, \nlocal TS and NS-specific growth charts would be most suitable \nfor individual growth monitoring in different countries. \nHowever, developing these charts can be difficult. It is of note \nthat there are no other disease-specific growth charts in TS and \nNS for Asian populations except for our charts. If our charts \nare used for other Asian populations, physicians should bear in \nmind how growth patterns in their countries differ from those \nin Japanese. For example, if our charts were utilized by Korean \nphysicians, they should know the difference in growth patterns \nbetween the two countries. Fig. 1 shows growth charts of the \nnormal Japanese population\n46) superimposed on the normal \nKorean population\n47). As the figure shows, there is considerable \noverlap except for younger and pubertal ages. Therefore, our TS \nand NS-specific growth charts might be applicable as long as \nphysicians are aware of the different growth patterns between \ntwo countries in the general population.\nConclusions\nDisease-specific growth charts are very useful tools. Theoreti\u00ad\ncally, these charts should be constructed for each ethnic group. \nHowever, gathering unbiased subject measurements is very \nchallenging. Here, we reviewed the development of disease-\nspecific charts for Japanese individuals with TS and NS. When \nusing disease-specific charts developed using data from other \nethnic groups, physicians should consider the underlying \ndifferences in normal growth patterns between ethnic groups.\nConflict of interest\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was \nreported.\nReferences \n1.\t\nHermanussen M.

As the growth patterns of affected \nindividuals differ from those of normal populations, it is challenging to detect \nadditional conditions that can influence growth using standard growth charts. \nDisease-specific growth charts are thus very useful tools and can be helpful for \nunderstanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis of congenital diseases. In \naddition, disease-specific growth charts allow doctors to detect deviations from \nthe usual growth patterns for early diagnosis of an additional condition and can \nbe used to evaluate the effects of growth-promoting treatment for patients. When \ndeveloping these charts, factors that can affect the reliability of the charts should \nbe considered. These factors include the definition of the disease with growth \nfailure, selection bias in the measurements used to develop the charts, secular \ntrends of the subjects, the numbers of subjects of varying ages and ethnicities, and \nthe statistical method used to develop the charts. In this review, we summarize the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with Turner \nsyndrome and Noonan syndrome and evaluate the efforts to collect unbiased \nmeasurements of subjects with these diseases. These charts were the only available \ndisease-specific growth charts of Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome for Asian \npopulations and were developed using a Japanese population. Therefore, when \nthese charts are adopted for Asian populations other than Japanese, different \ngrowth patterns should be considered. \nKeywords: Growth charts, Disease-specific growth chart, Turner syndrome, Noonan \nsyndrome, LMS method, Asian population\nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\n1,\nSusumu Yokoya, MD, PhD\n2\n1Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, \nTokyo, \n2Fukushima Global Medical \nScience Center, Fukushima Medical \nUniversity, Fukushima, Japan\nhttps://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.4.240\nAnn Pediatr Endocrinol Metab 2017;22:240-246\n\u00a92017 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism\nReceived: 12 December, 2017\nAccepted: 18 December, 2017\nAddress for correspondence: \nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, 2-11-\n1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-8606, \nJapan\nTel: +81-3-3964-1211\nFax: +81-3-3579-8212\nE-mail: isojimat-tky@umin.ac.jp\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-0011-\n0325\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nISSN: 2287-1012(Print) \nISSN: 2287-1292(Online) \nIntroduction\nGrowth charts are vital tools used worldwide for evaluating the growth of children in clinical \nsettings as well as public health examinations\n1,2). These charts enable physicians to compare the \ngrowth of an individual with that of the general population, assessing whether the individual \nhas growth failure or not. Starting with such assessment, a physician can investigate a specific \ndiagnosis for an individual with growth failure, although the diagnosis is usually determined \nby other findings such as clinical features, hormone levels, karyotyping, or bone radiographs.\nMany congenital diseases are associated with growth failure, and patients with these diseases \nshow characteristic growth patterns. As the growth patterns of affected individuals differ \nfrom those of the normal population, it is challenging to detect additional conditions that \ninfluence their growth using growth charts for the normal population. In clinical settings, it is \nessential for physicians to consider other possible contributory factors besides the established \ndiagnosis. To that end, disease-specific growth charts are very useful and are necessary for \nseveral reasons\n3). First, they are helpful for understanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis \nof a disease. Second, they enable the detection of deviations from typical growth patterns in \n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n241\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\naffected individuals and aid in early diagnosis of additional \nconditions. Finally, they are very useful for evaluating the \neffects of growth-promoting treatment among patients. At \npresent, disease-specific growth charts are available for several \nsyndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, \nWilliams syndrome, Turner syndrome (TS), and Noonan \nsyndrome (NS)\n4-10).\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, we should \nconsider several factors that may affect the reliability of the \ncharts (Table 1). First, we should determine if the disease with \ngrowth failure can be precisely defined. If the pathogenesis \nor etiology of the disease is ambiguous, we cannot admit the \nsignificance of disease-specific growth charts. Second, we should \navoid selection bias in subject measurements whenever possible. \nIt often occurs that subjects recruited for measurements are not \nrepresentative of the overall disease population, as diagnoses \nare usually made after many symptoms manifest. Therefore, it \nis possible that the sample used for measurements is biased by \ndelayed diagnosis of the disease, and if we analyzed only cross-\nsectional data, the developed disease-specific growth charts \nmay show biased and different growth patterns. This will be \ndiscussed later in the example on the development of growth \ncharts in TS. Additional selection bias may derive from the \nspecialties of the physicians seeing the patients, which will be \ndiscussed later in the example of the development of growth \ncharts in NS. Briefly, in clinically heterogeneous disease such \nas NS where many specialists are involved in care, subject \nmeasurements should be obtained from multidisciplinary \nspecialists. In addition, the rearing environment of the subjects \nmay cause selection bias. Third, we should consider secular \ntrends among subjects when gathering data. For rare diseases, \nit can be difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients. \nTherefore, we tend to recruit subjects over many years, which \ncan cause the developed disease-specific growth charts to be \naffected by secular growth trends. Fourth, we should collect \nmeasurements from a sufficient number of patients of all ages \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. If insufficient \nsubjects are available in certain age categories, a bump or a \ndip will be observed in the growth charts, which reflects the \nsampling error that occurs with a small number of subjects. \nFifth, we should consider that ethnicity can influence the \ngrowth of children with a disease. Finally, we should analyze \nprecise anthropometric data using proper statistical methods. \nConsidering all these factors, it seems almost impossible to \ncollect ideal data to establish true disease-specific standards. \nHowever, is it necessary to do so because disease-specific growth \nreferences remain meaningful tools for physicians in various \nclinical settings\n3). In this review, we summarize our experiences \ndeveloping disease-specific growth charts in TS\n8) and NS\n9,10).\nDevelopment of growth charts in TS\nTS is a chromosomal disorder occurring in females that is \ncharacterized by short stature and primary ovarian failure. It is \nthe most common chromosomal disorder in females, and the \nincidence is estimated at 1 in 1,500\u20132,500 live births\n11-13). TS is \ndefined by a karyotype that contains a cell line of monosomy \nlacking at least the distal major part of the short arm of one X \nchromosome. The growth patterns of TS girls are different from \nthose of normal individuals\n11-13). The birth length in TS is smaller \nthan that in normal populations due to mild growth delay in \nutero. After birth, the growth velocity gradually declines. The \nlength/height of girls with TS often remains within the normal \nrange during infancy, but usually falls below the fifth percentile \nof the normal population by the age of 5 years. Growth failure is \nmore evident as girls become mature, and growth spurts are not \nobserved during the expected pubertal period. Untreated adults \nwith TS are reported to be approximately 20 cm shorter than \nnormal female adults\n14).\nTS-specific growth charts are available in many coun\u00ad\ntries\n8,15-23). In Japan, the first TS-specific growth charts were \ndeveloped by Suwa\n20) in 1992. These charts were constructed \nusing data from 704 girls with TS (6,255 measurements) born \nfrom 1955 to 1989 (median unknown), meaning that most of \nthe analyzed subjects were born in 1972 or earlier. As the secular \ntrend of increasing height among Japanese children reached a \nplateau around 1990\n7), the TS-specific growth charts developed \nby Suwa\n20) became inappropriate for the evaluation of girls \nrecently diagnosed with TS. Thus, revisions to the charts were \nnecessary.\nFor the development of revised TS-specific growth charts, we \nutilized a database from the Foundation for Growth Science\n24). \nThis database controls for the use of growth hormone (GH) \nthrough its registration system and contains pretreatment data \nfor TS patients across Japan. After data cleaning and analyzing \npretreatment data for girls with TS born in 1970 or later, cross-\nsectional growth charts were constructed\n7). However, there was \na problem that the growth charts were shifted downward in \nyounger ages, which seemed to be due to selection bias. Girls \nwith TS who registered with the Foundation during infancy \ntended to be smaller than those who registered beyond infancy, \nbecause the degree of height difference between girls with TS \nand the normal population was smaller in infancy. On the other \nhand, girls with TS who registered at older ages might not have \nbeen affected by this selection bias because the height difference \nTable 1.

In brief, taller \nTS patients are often diagnosed only in older ages. To solve \nthis problem, data for relatively tall TS girls during infancy was \nneeded. To address this issue, we utilized semilongitudinal data \nfor girls with TS diagnosed at older ages. As the Foundation \ndatabase only included 3 consecutive years of data prior to GH \ntreatment, we could not obtain enough data from this source. \nTherefore, we collected new longitudinal data from the medical \nrecords of 205 girls with TS who sought treatment at 2 major \nhospitals in Tokyo (the National Center for Child Health and \nDevelopment and Toranomon Hospital) and used these data \nfor the revision of the growth charts. From the 2 datasets, 2,072 \nsubjects (born from 1970 to 2006, median 1985) were available. \nAfter excluding individuals who lacked the typical TS karyotype \n(n=31), those with spontaneous puberty (n=144), unknown \npuberty at the time of height and weight measurement (n=14), \na history of growth-promoting treatment (n=264), measured \nvalues exceeding \u00b15 standard deviation (SD) in the study \npopulation (n=4), and duplicate registration (n=50), 1,565 \nsubjects were retained for analysis. The presence of puberty was \njudged by statements in the application form (for Foundation \ndata) or the attainment of Tanner 2 breast development \n(for hospital data). Of the 5,796 measurements from 1,565 \nsubjects before growth-promoting treatment, an additional \n24 measurements were excluded because they fell outside \nthe range of \u00b15 SD of the population mean. New TS-specific \ngrowth charts were then constructed from the remaining 5,772 \nmeasurements using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nBased on the new TS-specific growth chart, the mean height \nof an adult female with TS is 141.3\u00b15.6 cm, which is comparable \nto data from other Japanese TS samples (e.g., 143.0\u00b14.9 cm, 18 \nTS females without GH treatment)\n26). According to the chart, \nindividuals with TS at the age of 20 years are, on average, -3.30 \nSD below the mean height for the normal population, which \nis similar to data from foreign countries (-2.54 to -4.15 SD)\n14). \nThese findings support the validity of the new TS-specific \ngrowth chart.\nGirls with TS with spontaneous puberty are significantly \ntaller than those without spontaneous puberty at the age of \n\u226512 years, but the difference is no longer significant when \nthey reach their adult height\n22). Thus, 2 types of growth charts \nmay be necessary during the peripubertal period. However, \nwe only produced TS-specific growth charts for girls without \nspontaneous puberty due to the limited number of pubertal \nsubjects. Nevertheless, when we plotted the measurements from \n144 subjects with spontaneous puberty on the new charts, all \nexcept for 5 measurements were distributed within \u00b12 SD. This \nfinding suggests that the new TS-specific growth charts can be \nused for girls with TS with spontaneous puberty.\nThrough these processes, new TS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese girls were constructed\n8). We believe that the new TS-\nspecific charts can be presumed to be representative of growth \nin girls with TS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practices. In \naddition, these charts are the only TS-specific growth charts \nbased on an Asian population.\nDevelopment of growth charts in NS\nNS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome \nwith an estimated incidence of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 \nlive births\n27-29). The cardinal features of NS are distinctive facial \ncharacteristics that change with age, short stature, congenital \nheart disease, and chest deformity\n27,30). Clinical features of NS \ncan vary within a family, but become more subtle in adult life\n31). \nIndividuals with NS are typically treated by a multidisciplinary \nteam of specialists, which includes pediatric geneticists, \npediatric cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists.\nThe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling \npathway is an essential signaling pathway that controls cell \nproliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein-\ntyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene, \nwhich encodes a tyrosine phosphatase protein involved in \nthe Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, was identified as the first \ncausative gene in NS patients\n32). Increasing evidence indicates \nthat germline mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK \nsignaling pathway cause NS and Noonan-related syndrome\n33). \nWhile mutations in such genes have been identified in \napproximately 60%\u201370% of patients with NS\n34,35), the diagnosis \nof NS remains clinical\n27,36). Several scoring systems are currently \navailable for diagnosis, with the scoring system developed by \nvan der Burgt et al.\n37) in 1994 being the most widely used.\nGrowth patterns of children with NS are different from \nthose of the normal population. The mean birth length is \nslightly shorter, but within the normal range. However, a rapid \ndecline in length/height SD score (SDS) relative to the normal \npopulation develops during the first year of life. Thereafter, \nmean length/height lies approximately on the -2.5 SD line for \nthe normal population until age 12 years in boys and 10.5 years \nin girls. Afterwards, further decline becomes obvious due to \ndelayed puberty, and then the height SDS relative to the normal \npopulation tends to recover.\nNS-specific growth curves are currently available for 4 regions: \nBrazil, Europe, North America, and Japan\n9,10,38-40). Undoubtedly, \nNS-specific charts should be developed with data collected by \nmultidisciplinary specialists. Therefore, when we constructed \nNS-specific growth charts\n9,10), we conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of pediatric geneticists, pediatric cardiologists, and \npediatric endocrinologists responsible for Japanese NS patients. \nWe collaborated with three academic societies (i.e., The Japan \nSociety of Pediatric Genetics, The Japanese Society of Pediatric \nCardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and The Japanese Society for \nPediatric Endocrinology) and gathered data for NS patients \ndiagnosed by specialists from these societies at 31 hospitals \nnationwide. Due to secular trends in height, we recruited \npatients born in 1970 or later\n7). Questionnaires that included \nauxological measurements together with a minimal set of \nclinical and genetic data were sent to these hospitals. Height and \nweight measurements were gathered in a mixed longitudinal \nand cross-sectional manner. The minimal interval between 2 \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n243\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\nmeasurements was 1 month when the subjects were measured \nbefore 1 year of age or 3 months when measured after 1 year of \nage.\nTwenty of the 31 hospitals responded to our questionnaire, \nresulting in data for 356 clinically diagnosed NS patients. A total \nof 48 subjects were excluded because of missing auxological \ndata (n=26), presence of complications that might have affected \ngrowth (n=5), or extreme longitudinal growth aberrations \u00b13 \nSD from the mean (n=17). The remaining 308 subjects (159 \nboys, 149 girls) were analyzed. To develop the growth charts, \n3,249 measurements (boys, 1,674; girls, 1,575) were included \nafter exclusion of 23 measurements from three outliers. Height \nSDSs were not significantly different between individuals with \nand without genetic analysis (difference, 0.076; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.020 to 0.17; P=0.12). NS-specific growth charts \nwere constructed using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nSubjects were diagnosed with NS by certified specialists, \nand thus, diagnoses were very reliable. Moreover, diagnosis \nwas further validated by the scoring system developed by van \nder Burgt et al.\n37). All measurements were properly selected \nby excluding individuals with previous growth-promoting \ntreatment, complications that may affect growth, and extreme \nlongitudinal growth aberrations. Based on the NS-specific \ngrowth charts, adult height is 157.3\u00b17.4 cm for males (-2.3\u00b11.3 \nSDS) and 146.8\u00b16.9 cm for females (-2.1\u00b11.3 SDS). These adult \nheight SDSs for the normal population are comparable to values \nreported in other countries (male, -2.5 to -1.4; female, -2.2 to \n-1.8)\n38-42).\nThrough these processes, NS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese individuals were constructed\n9,10). We believe that \nthese charts can be presumed to be representative of growth in \nindividuals with NS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practice. \nMoreover, these are the only NS-specific growth charts based on \nmeasurements from an Asian population.\nStatistical method used for developing \ngrowth charts\nThe lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method\n43) was used for the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese \nindividuals with TS and NS. The LMS method is a standard \nmethod for establishing growth charts\n44) and is effective at \nconstructing reference charts that show the distribution of \na measurement as it changes by covariates such as age and \ntime. The LMS method includes smoothing with a spline \nfunction after normalizing age-specific data using a power \ntransformation. In this method, the degree of skewness (L), \nmedian (M), and coefficient of variation (S) are estimated by \nage, and SD scores (Z-scores) of each index can be calculated \nfrom the L, M, and S values. This method also allows the \ncalculation of percentiles, as SD scores can be converted to \npercentiles in a normal distribution. The LMS method is usually \nused for establishing growth charts based on cross-sectional \ndata. However, it can also be used for establishing growth \ncharts based on longitudinal data when the measurements are \nwidely scattered and there are no subjects with a nonnegligible \ninfluence on the charts\n9,45). In the data used for development of \ndisease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with TS \nand NS, numerous measurements were scattered across the age \nrange and all subjects had a significant influence on the growth \ncharts.\nDiscussion\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, it is essential \nto collect anthropometric measurements that reflect the true \ndisease population. Therefore, we made maximal efforts to \nobtain unbiased data for subjects with TS and NS that were \nrepresentative of overall TS and NS populations in Japan. Table \n2 summarizes the characteristics considered in the development \nof disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with \nTS and NS. For TS, we first utilized an existing nationwide \ncohort of TS patients before GH treatment in Japan. However, \nthis cohort did not represent the true population of TS due \nto diagnosis bias. To overcome this significant selection bias, \nwe compiled new hospital data in addition to the cohort data \nand analyzed both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. \nThese efforts have made the TS-specific charts closer to the \ntrue TS standards. For NS, there was not an existing cohort with \nanthropometric data. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide \nquestionnaire survey of multidisciplinary specialists, as NS is a \nclinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. As diagnosis \nof NS can be difficult, it was essential to have reliable diagnoses. \nTo do so, we only compiled data for subjects diagnosed by \ncertified specialists and validated the diagnosis using the \nscoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.\n37). Although \nthese efforts may not be perfect, we believe that the collected \nTable 2.

As the population of Japan is generally considered \nethnically homogeneous, we did not need to consider ethnicity \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. Theoretically, \nlocal TS and NS-specific growth charts would be most suitable \nfor individual growth monitoring in different countries. \nHowever, developing these charts can be difficult. It is of note \nthat there are no other disease-specific growth charts in TS and \nNS for Asian populations except for our charts. If our charts \nare used for other Asian populations, physicians should bear in \nmind how growth patterns in their countries differ from those \nin Japanese. For example, if our charts were utilized by Korean \nphysicians, they should know the difference in growth patterns \nbetween the two countries. Fig. 1 shows growth charts of the \nnormal Japanese population\n46) superimposed on the normal \nKorean population\n47). As the figure shows, there is considerable \noverlap except for younger and pubertal ages. Therefore, our TS \nand NS-specific growth charts might be applicable as long as \nphysicians are aware of the different growth patterns between \ntwo countries in the general population.\nConclusions\nDisease-specific growth charts are very useful tools. Theoreti\u00ad\ncally, these charts should be constructed for each ethnic group. \nHowever, gathering unbiased subject measurements is very \nchallenging. Here, we reviewed the development of disease-\nspecific charts for Japanese individuals with TS and NS. When \nusing disease-specific charts developed using data from other \nethnic groups, physicians should consider the underlying \ndifferences in normal growth patterns between ethnic groups.\nConflict of interest\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was \nreported.\nReferences \n1.\t\nHermanussen M.

As the growth patterns of affected \nindividuals differ from those of normal populations, it is challenging to detect \nadditional conditions that can influence growth using standard growth charts. \nDisease-specific growth charts are thus very useful tools and can be helpful for \nunderstanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis of congenital diseases. In \naddition, disease-specific growth charts allow doctors to detect deviations from \nthe usual growth patterns for early diagnosis of an additional condition and can \nbe used to evaluate the effects of growth-promoting treatment for patients. When \ndeveloping these charts, factors that can affect the reliability of the charts should \nbe considered. These factors include the definition of the disease with growth \nfailure, selection bias in the measurements used to develop the charts, secular \ntrends of the subjects, the numbers of subjects of varying ages and ethnicities, and \nthe statistical method used to develop the charts. In this review, we summarize the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with Turner \nsyndrome and Noonan syndrome and evaluate the efforts to collect unbiased \nmeasurements of subjects with these diseases. These charts were the only available \ndisease-specific growth charts of Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome for Asian \npopulations and were developed using a Japanese population. Therefore, when \nthese charts are adopted for Asian populations other than Japanese, different \ngrowth patterns should be considered. \nKeywords: Growth charts, Disease-specific growth chart, Turner syndrome, Noonan \nsyndrome, LMS method, Asian population\nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\n1,\nSusumu Yokoya, MD, PhD\n2\n1Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, \nTokyo, \n2Fukushima Global Medical \nScience Center, Fukushima Medical \nUniversity, Fukushima, Japan\nhttps://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.4.240\nAnn Pediatr Endocrinol Metab 2017;22:240-246\n\u00a92017 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism\nReceived: 12 December, 2017\nAccepted: 18 December, 2017\nAddress for correspondence: \nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, 2-11-\n1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-8606, \nJapan\nTel: +81-3-3964-1211\nFax: +81-3-3579-8212\nE-mail: isojimat-tky@umin.ac.jp\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-0011-\n0325\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nISSN: 2287-1012(Print) \nISSN: 2287-1292(Online) \nIntroduction\nGrowth charts are vital tools used worldwide for evaluating the growth of children in clinical \nsettings as well as public health examinations\n1,2). These charts enable physicians to compare the \ngrowth of an individual with that of the general population, assessing whether the individual \nhas growth failure or not. Starting with such assessment, a physician can investigate a specific \ndiagnosis for an individual with growth failure, although the diagnosis is usually determined \nby other findings such as clinical features, hormone levels, karyotyping, or bone radiographs.\nMany congenital diseases are associated with growth failure, and patients with these diseases \nshow characteristic growth patterns. As the growth patterns of affected individuals differ \nfrom those of the normal population, it is challenging to detect additional conditions that \ninfluence their growth using growth charts for the normal population. In clinical settings, it is \nessential for physicians to consider other possible contributory factors besides the established \ndiagnosis. To that end, disease-specific growth charts are very useful and are necessary for \nseveral reasons\n3). First, they are helpful for understanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis \nof a disease. Second, they enable the detection of deviations from typical growth patterns in \n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n241\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\naffected individuals and aid in early diagnosis of additional \nconditions. Finally, they are very useful for evaluating the \neffects of growth-promoting treatment among patients. At \npresent, disease-specific growth charts are available for several \nsyndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, \nWilliams syndrome, Turner syndrome (TS), and Noonan \nsyndrome (NS)\n4-10).\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, we should \nconsider several factors that may affect the reliability of the \ncharts (Table 1). First, we should determine if the disease with \ngrowth failure can be precisely defined. If the pathogenesis \nor etiology of the disease is ambiguous, we cannot admit the \nsignificance of disease-specific growth charts. Second, we should \navoid selection bias in subject measurements whenever possible. \nIt often occurs that subjects recruited for measurements are not \nrepresentative of the overall disease population, as diagnoses \nare usually made after many symptoms manifest. Therefore, it \nis possible that the sample used for measurements is biased by \ndelayed diagnosis of the disease, and if we analyzed only cross-\nsectional data, the developed disease-specific growth charts \nmay show biased and different growth patterns. This will be \ndiscussed later in the example on the development of growth \ncharts in TS. Additional selection bias may derive from the \nspecialties of the physicians seeing the patients, which will be \ndiscussed later in the example of the development of growth \ncharts in NS. Briefly, in clinically heterogeneous disease such \nas NS where many specialists are involved in care, subject \nmeasurements should be obtained from multidisciplinary \nspecialists. In addition, the rearing environment of the subjects \nmay cause selection bias. Third, we should consider secular \ntrends among subjects when gathering data. For rare diseases, \nit can be difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients. \nTherefore, we tend to recruit subjects over many years, which \ncan cause the developed disease-specific growth charts to be \naffected by secular growth trends. Fourth, we should collect \nmeasurements from a sufficient number of patients of all ages \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. If insufficient \nsubjects are available in certain age categories, a bump or a \ndip will be observed in the growth charts, which reflects the \nsampling error that occurs with a small number of subjects. \nFifth, we should consider that ethnicity can influence the \ngrowth of children with a disease. Finally, we should analyze \nprecise anthropometric data using proper statistical methods. \nConsidering all these factors, it seems almost impossible to \ncollect ideal data to establish true disease-specific standards. \nHowever, is it necessary to do so because disease-specific growth \nreferences remain meaningful tools for physicians in various \nclinical settings\n3). In this review, we summarize our experiences \ndeveloping disease-specific growth charts in TS\n8) and NS\n9,10).\nDevelopment of growth charts in TS\nTS is a chromosomal disorder occurring in females that is \ncharacterized by short stature and primary ovarian failure. It is \nthe most common chromosomal disorder in females, and the \nincidence is estimated at 1 in 1,500\u20132,500 live births\n11-13). TS is \ndefined by a karyotype that contains a cell line of monosomy \nlacking at least the distal major part of the short arm of one X \nchromosome. The growth patterns of TS girls are different from \nthose of normal individuals\n11-13). The birth length in TS is smaller \nthan that in normal populations due to mild growth delay in \nutero. After birth, the growth velocity gradually declines. The \nlength/height of girls with TS often remains within the normal \nrange during infancy, but usually falls below the fifth percentile \nof the normal population by the age of 5 years. Growth failure is \nmore evident as girls become mature, and growth spurts are not \nobserved during the expected pubertal period. Untreated adults \nwith TS are reported to be approximately 20 cm shorter than \nnormal female adults\n14).\nTS-specific growth charts are available in many coun\u00ad\ntries\n8,15-23). In Japan, the first TS-specific growth charts were \ndeveloped by Suwa\n20) in 1992. These charts were constructed \nusing data from 704 girls with TS (6,255 measurements) born \nfrom 1955 to 1989 (median unknown), meaning that most of \nthe analyzed subjects were born in 1972 or earlier. As the secular \ntrend of increasing height among Japanese children reached a \nplateau around 1990\n7), the TS-specific growth charts developed \nby Suwa\n20) became inappropriate for the evaluation of girls \nrecently diagnosed with TS. Thus, revisions to the charts were \nnecessary.\nFor the development of revised TS-specific growth charts, we \nutilized a database from the Foundation for Growth Science\n24). \nThis database controls for the use of growth hormone (GH) \nthrough its registration system and contains pretreatment data \nfor TS patients across Japan. After data cleaning and analyzing \npretreatment data for girls with TS born in 1970 or later, cross-\nsectional growth charts were constructed\n7). However, there was \na problem that the growth charts were shifted downward in \nyounger ages, which seemed to be due to selection bias. Girls \nwith TS who registered with the Foundation during infancy \ntended to be smaller than those who registered beyond infancy, \nbecause the degree of height difference between girls with TS \nand the normal population was smaller in infancy. On the other \nhand, girls with TS who registered at older ages might not have \nbeen affected by this selection bias because the height difference \nTable 1.

In brief, taller \nTS patients are often diagnosed only in older ages. To solve \nthis problem, data for relatively tall TS girls during infancy was \nneeded. To address this issue, we utilized semilongitudinal data \nfor girls with TS diagnosed at older ages. As the Foundation \ndatabase only included 3 consecutive years of data prior to GH \ntreatment, we could not obtain enough data from this source. \nTherefore, we collected new longitudinal data from the medical \nrecords of 205 girls with TS who sought treatment at 2 major \nhospitals in Tokyo (the National Center for Child Health and \nDevelopment and Toranomon Hospital) and used these data \nfor the revision of the growth charts. From the 2 datasets, 2,072 \nsubjects (born from 1970 to 2006, median 1985) were available. \nAfter excluding individuals who lacked the typical TS karyotype \n(n=31), those with spontaneous puberty (n=144), unknown \npuberty at the time of height and weight measurement (n=14), \na history of growth-promoting treatment (n=264), measured \nvalues exceeding \u00b15 standard deviation (SD) in the study \npopulation (n=4), and duplicate registration (n=50), 1,565 \nsubjects were retained for analysis. The presence of puberty was \njudged by statements in the application form (for Foundation \ndata) or the attainment of Tanner 2 breast development \n(for hospital data). Of the 5,796 measurements from 1,565 \nsubjects before growth-promoting treatment, an additional \n24 measurements were excluded because they fell outside \nthe range of \u00b15 SD of the population mean. New TS-specific \ngrowth charts were then constructed from the remaining 5,772 \nmeasurements using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nBased on the new TS-specific growth chart, the mean height \nof an adult female with TS is 141.3\u00b15.6 cm, which is comparable \nto data from other Japanese TS samples (e.g., 143.0\u00b14.9 cm, 18 \nTS females without GH treatment)\n26). According to the chart, \nindividuals with TS at the age of 20 years are, on average, -3.30 \nSD below the mean height for the normal population, which \nis similar to data from foreign countries (-2.54 to -4.15 SD)\n14). \nThese findings support the validity of the new TS-specific \ngrowth chart.\nGirls with TS with spontaneous puberty are significantly \ntaller than those without spontaneous puberty at the age of \n\u226512 years, but the difference is no longer significant when \nthey reach their adult height\n22). Thus, 2 types of growth charts \nmay be necessary during the peripubertal period. However, \nwe only produced TS-specific growth charts for girls without \nspontaneous puberty due to the limited number of pubertal \nsubjects. Nevertheless, when we plotted the measurements from \n144 subjects with spontaneous puberty on the new charts, all \nexcept for 5 measurements were distributed within \u00b12 SD. This \nfinding suggests that the new TS-specific growth charts can be \nused for girls with TS with spontaneous puberty.\nThrough these processes, new TS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese girls were constructed\n8). We believe that the new TS-\nspecific charts can be presumed to be representative of growth \nin girls with TS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practices. In \naddition, these charts are the only TS-specific growth charts \nbased on an Asian population.\nDevelopment of growth charts in NS\nNS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome \nwith an estimated incidence of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 \nlive births\n27-29). The cardinal features of NS are distinctive facial \ncharacteristics that change with age, short stature, congenital \nheart disease, and chest deformity\n27,30). Clinical features of NS \ncan vary within a family, but become more subtle in adult life\n31). \nIndividuals with NS are typically treated by a multidisciplinary \nteam of specialists, which includes pediatric geneticists, \npediatric cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists.\nThe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling \npathway is an essential signaling pathway that controls cell \nproliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein-\ntyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene, \nwhich encodes a tyrosine phosphatase protein involved in \nthe Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, was identified as the first \ncausative gene in NS patients\n32). Increasing evidence indicates \nthat germline mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK \nsignaling pathway cause NS and Noonan-related syndrome\n33). \nWhile mutations in such genes have been identified in \napproximately 60%\u201370% of patients with NS\n34,35), the diagnosis \nof NS remains clinical\n27,36). Several scoring systems are currently \navailable for diagnosis, with the scoring system developed by \nvan der Burgt et al.\n37) in 1994 being the most widely used.\nGrowth patterns of children with NS are different from \nthose of the normal population. The mean birth length is \nslightly shorter, but within the normal range. However, a rapid \ndecline in length/height SD score (SDS) relative to the normal \npopulation develops during the first year of life. Thereafter, \nmean length/height lies approximately on the -2.5 SD line for \nthe normal population until age 12 years in boys and 10.5 years \nin girls. Afterwards, further decline becomes obvious due to \ndelayed puberty, and then the height SDS relative to the normal \npopulation tends to recover.\nNS-specific growth curves are currently available for 4 regions: \nBrazil, Europe, North America, and Japan\n9,10,38-40). Undoubtedly, \nNS-specific charts should be developed with data collected by \nmultidisciplinary specialists. Therefore, when we constructed \nNS-specific growth charts\n9,10), we conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of pediatric geneticists, pediatric cardiologists, and \npediatric endocrinologists responsible for Japanese NS patients. \nWe collaborated with three academic societies (i.e., The Japan \nSociety of Pediatric Genetics, The Japanese Society of Pediatric \nCardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and The Japanese Society for \nPediatric Endocrinology) and gathered data for NS patients \ndiagnosed by specialists from these societies at 31 hospitals \nnationwide. Due to secular trends in height, we recruited \npatients born in 1970 or later\n7). Questionnaires that included \nauxological measurements together with a minimal set of \nclinical and genetic data were sent to these hospitals. Height and \nweight measurements were gathered in a mixed longitudinal \nand cross-sectional manner. The minimal interval between 2 \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n243\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\nmeasurements was 1 month when the subjects were measured \nbefore 1 year of age or 3 months when measured after 1 year of \nage.\nTwenty of the 31 hospitals responded to our questionnaire, \nresulting in data for 356 clinically diagnosed NS patients. A total \nof 48 subjects were excluded because of missing auxological \ndata (n=26), presence of complications that might have affected \ngrowth (n=5), or extreme longitudinal growth aberrations \u00b13 \nSD from the mean (n=17). The remaining 308 subjects (159 \nboys, 149 girls) were analyzed. To develop the growth charts, \n3,249 measurements (boys, 1,674; girls, 1,575) were included \nafter exclusion of 23 measurements from three outliers. Height \nSDSs were not significantly different between individuals with \nand without genetic analysis (difference, 0.076; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.020 to 0.17; P=0.12). NS-specific growth charts \nwere constructed using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nSubjects were diagnosed with NS by certified specialists, \nand thus, diagnoses were very reliable. Moreover, diagnosis \nwas further validated by the scoring system developed by van \nder Burgt et al.\n37). All measurements were properly selected \nby excluding individuals with previous growth-promoting \ntreatment, complications that may affect growth, and extreme \nlongitudinal growth aberrations. Based on the NS-specific \ngrowth charts, adult height is 157.3\u00b17.4 cm for males (-2.3\u00b11.3 \nSDS) and 146.8\u00b16.9 cm for females (-2.1\u00b11.3 SDS). These adult \nheight SDSs for the normal population are comparable to values \nreported in other countries (male, -2.5 to -1.4; female, -2.2 to \n-1.8)\n38-42).\nThrough these processes, NS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese individuals were constructed\n9,10). We believe that \nthese charts can be presumed to be representative of growth in \nindividuals with NS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practice. \nMoreover, these are the only NS-specific growth charts based on \nmeasurements from an Asian population.\nStatistical method used for developing \ngrowth charts\nThe lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method\n43) was used for the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese \nindividuals with TS and NS. The LMS method is a standard \nmethod for establishing growth charts\n44) and is effective at \nconstructing reference charts that show the distribution of \na measurement as it changes by covariates such as age and \ntime. The LMS method includes smoothing with a spline \nfunction after normalizing age-specific data using a power \ntransformation. In this method, the degree of skewness (L), \nmedian (M), and coefficient of variation (S) are estimated by \nage, and SD scores (Z-scores) of each index can be calculated \nfrom the L, M, and S values. This method also allows the \ncalculation of percentiles, as SD scores can be converted to \npercentiles in a normal distribution. The LMS method is usually \nused for establishing growth charts based on cross-sectional \ndata. However, it can also be used for establishing growth \ncharts based on longitudinal data when the measurements are \nwidely scattered and there are no subjects with a nonnegligible \ninfluence on the charts\n9,45). In the data used for development of \ndisease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with TS \nand NS, numerous measurements were scattered across the age \nrange and all subjects had a significant influence on the growth \ncharts.\nDiscussion\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, it is essential \nto collect anthropometric measurements that reflect the true \ndisease population. Therefore, we made maximal efforts to \nobtain unbiased data for subjects with TS and NS that were \nrepresentative of overall TS and NS populations in Japan. Table \n2 summarizes the characteristics considered in the development \nof disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with \nTS and NS. For TS, we first utilized an existing nationwide \ncohort of TS patients before GH treatment in Japan. However, \nthis cohort did not represent the true population of TS due \nto diagnosis bias. To overcome this significant selection bias, \nwe compiled new hospital data in addition to the cohort data \nand analyzed both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. \nThese efforts have made the TS-specific charts closer to the \ntrue TS standards. For NS, there was not an existing cohort with \nanthropometric data. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide \nquestionnaire survey of multidisciplinary specialists, as NS is a \nclinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. As diagnosis \nof NS can be difficult, it was essential to have reliable diagnoses. \nTo do so, we only compiled data for subjects diagnosed by \ncertified specialists and validated the diagnosis using the \nscoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.\n37). Although \nthese efforts may not be perfect, we believe that the collected \nTable 2.

As the population of Japan is generally considered \nethnically homogeneous, we did not need to consider ethnicity \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. Theoretically, \nlocal TS and NS-specific growth charts would be most suitable \nfor individual growth monitoring in different countries. \nHowever, developing these charts can be difficult. It is of note \nthat there are no other disease-specific growth charts in TS and \nNS for Asian populations except for our charts. If our charts \nare used for other Asian populations, physicians should bear in \nmind how growth patterns in their countries differ from those \nin Japanese. For example, if our charts were utilized by Korean \nphysicians, they should know the difference in growth patterns \nbetween the two countries. Fig. 1 shows growth charts of the \nnormal Japanese population\n46) superimposed on the normal \nKorean population\n47). As the figure shows, there is considerable \noverlap except for younger and pubertal ages. Therefore, our TS \nand NS-specific growth charts might be applicable as long as \nphysicians are aware of the different growth patterns between \ntwo countries in the general population.\nConclusions\nDisease-specific growth charts are very useful tools. Theoreti\u00ad\ncally, these charts should be constructed for each ethnic group. \nHowever, gathering unbiased subject measurements is very \nchallenging. Here, we reviewed the development of disease-\nspecific charts for Japanese individuals with TS and NS. When \nusing disease-specific charts developed using data from other \nethnic groups, physicians should consider the underlying \ndifferences in normal growth patterns between ethnic groups.\nConflict of interest\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was \nreported.\nReferences \n1.\t\nHermanussen M.

As the growth patterns of affected \nindividuals differ from those of normal populations, it is challenging to detect \nadditional conditions that can influence growth using standard growth charts. \nDisease-specific growth charts are thus very useful tools and can be helpful for \nunderstanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis of congenital diseases. In \naddition, disease-specific growth charts allow doctors to detect deviations from \nthe usual growth patterns for early diagnosis of an additional condition and can \nbe used to evaluate the effects of growth-promoting treatment for patients. When \ndeveloping these charts, factors that can affect the reliability of the charts should \nbe considered. These factors include the definition of the disease with growth \nfailure, selection bias in the measurements used to develop the charts, secular \ntrends of the subjects, the numbers of subjects of varying ages and ethnicities, and \nthe statistical method used to develop the charts. In this review, we summarize the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with Turner \nsyndrome and Noonan syndrome and evaluate the efforts to collect unbiased \nmeasurements of subjects with these diseases. These charts were the only available \ndisease-specific growth charts of Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome for Asian \npopulations and were developed using a Japanese population. Therefore, when \nthese charts are adopted for Asian populations other than Japanese, different \ngrowth patterns should be considered. \nKeywords: Growth charts, Disease-specific growth chart, Turner syndrome, Noonan \nsyndrome, LMS method, Asian population\nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\n1,\nSusumu Yokoya, MD, PhD\n2\n1Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, \nTokyo, \n2Fukushima Global Medical \nScience Center, Fukushima Medical \nUniversity, Fukushima, Japan\nhttps://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.4.240\nAnn Pediatr Endocrinol Metab 2017;22:240-246\n\u00a92017 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism\nReceived: 12 December, 2017\nAccepted: 18 December, 2017\nAddress for correspondence: \nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, 2-11-\n1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-8606, \nJapan\nTel: +81-3-3964-1211\nFax: +81-3-3579-8212\nE-mail: isojimat-tky@umin.ac.jp\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-0011-\n0325\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nISSN: 2287-1012(Print) \nISSN: 2287-1292(Online) \nIntroduction\nGrowth charts are vital tools used worldwide for evaluating the growth of children in clinical \nsettings as well as public health examinations\n1,2). These charts enable physicians to compare the \ngrowth of an individual with that of the general population, assessing whether the individual \nhas growth failure or not. Starting with such assessment, a physician can investigate a specific \ndiagnosis for an individual with growth failure, although the diagnosis is usually determined \nby other findings such as clinical features, hormone levels, karyotyping, or bone radiographs.\nMany congenital diseases are associated with growth failure, and patients with these diseases \nshow characteristic growth patterns. As the growth patterns of affected individuals differ \nfrom those of the normal population, it is challenging to detect additional conditions that \ninfluence their growth using growth charts for the normal population. In clinical settings, it is \nessential for physicians to consider other possible contributory factors besides the established \ndiagnosis. To that end, disease-specific growth charts are very useful and are necessary for \nseveral reasons\n3). First, they are helpful for understanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis \nof a disease. Second, they enable the detection of deviations from typical growth patterns in \n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n241\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\naffected individuals and aid in early diagnosis of additional \nconditions. Finally, they are very useful for evaluating the \neffects of growth-promoting treatment among patients. At \npresent, disease-specific growth charts are available for several \nsyndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, \nWilliams syndrome, Turner syndrome (TS), and Noonan \nsyndrome (NS)\n4-10).\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, we should \nconsider several factors that may affect the reliability of the \ncharts (Table 1). First, we should determine if the disease with \ngrowth failure can be precisely defined. If the pathogenesis \nor etiology of the disease is ambiguous, we cannot admit the \nsignificance of disease-specific growth charts. Second, we should \navoid selection bias in subject measurements whenever possible. \nIt often occurs that subjects recruited for measurements are not \nrepresentative of the overall disease population, as diagnoses \nare usually made after many symptoms manifest. Therefore, it \nis possible that the sample used for measurements is biased by \ndelayed diagnosis of the disease, and if we analyzed only cross-\nsectional data, the developed disease-specific growth charts \nmay show biased and different growth patterns. This will be \ndiscussed later in the example on the development of growth \ncharts in TS. Additional selection bias may derive from the \nspecialties of the physicians seeing the patients, which will be \ndiscussed later in the example of the development of growth \ncharts in NS. Briefly, in clinically heterogeneous disease such \nas NS where many specialists are involved in care, subject \nmeasurements should be obtained from multidisciplinary \nspecialists. In addition, the rearing environment of the subjects \nmay cause selection bias. Third, we should consider secular \ntrends among subjects when gathering data. For rare diseases, \nit can be difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients. \nTherefore, we tend to recruit subjects over many years, which \ncan cause the developed disease-specific growth charts to be \naffected by secular growth trends. Fourth, we should collect \nmeasurements from a sufficient number of patients of all ages \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. If insufficient \nsubjects are available in certain age categories, a bump or a \ndip will be observed in the growth charts, which reflects the \nsampling error that occurs with a small number of subjects. \nFifth, we should consider that ethnicity can influence the \ngrowth of children with a disease. Finally, we should analyze \nprecise anthropometric data using proper statistical methods. \nConsidering all these factors, it seems almost impossible to \ncollect ideal data to establish true disease-specific standards. \nHowever, is it necessary to do so because disease-specific growth \nreferences remain meaningful tools for physicians in various \nclinical settings\n3). In this review, we summarize our experiences \ndeveloping disease-specific growth charts in TS\n8) and NS\n9,10).\nDevelopment of growth charts in TS\nTS is a chromosomal disorder occurring in females that is \ncharacterized by short stature and primary ovarian failure. It is \nthe most common chromosomal disorder in females, and the \nincidence is estimated at 1 in 1,500\u20132,500 live births\n11-13). TS is \ndefined by a karyotype that contains a cell line of monosomy \nlacking at least the distal major part of the short arm of one X \nchromosome. The growth patterns of TS girls are different from \nthose of normal individuals\n11-13). The birth length in TS is smaller \nthan that in normal populations due to mild growth delay in \nutero. After birth, the growth velocity gradually declines. The \nlength/height of girls with TS often remains within the normal \nrange during infancy, but usually falls below the fifth percentile \nof the normal population by the age of 5 years. Growth failure is \nmore evident as girls become mature, and growth spurts are not \nobserved during the expected pubertal period. Untreated adults \nwith TS are reported to be approximately 20 cm shorter than \nnormal female adults\n14).\nTS-specific growth charts are available in many coun\u00ad\ntries\n8,15-23). In Japan, the first TS-specific growth charts were \ndeveloped by Suwa\n20) in 1992. These charts were constructed \nusing data from 704 girls with TS (6,255 measurements) born \nfrom 1955 to 1989 (median unknown), meaning that most of \nthe analyzed subjects were born in 1972 or earlier. As the secular \ntrend of increasing height among Japanese children reached a \nplateau around 1990\n7), the TS-specific growth charts developed \nby Suwa\n20) became inappropriate for the evaluation of girls \nrecently diagnosed with TS. Thus, revisions to the charts were \nnecessary.\nFor the development of revised TS-specific growth charts, we \nutilized a database from the Foundation for Growth Science\n24). \nThis database controls for the use of growth hormone (GH) \nthrough its registration system and contains pretreatment data \nfor TS patients across Japan. After data cleaning and analyzing \npretreatment data for girls with TS born in 1970 or later, cross-\nsectional growth charts were constructed\n7). However, there was \na problem that the growth charts were shifted downward in \nyounger ages, which seemed to be due to selection bias. Girls \nwith TS who registered with the Foundation during infancy \ntended to be smaller than those who registered beyond infancy, \nbecause the degree of height difference between girls with TS \nand the normal population was smaller in infancy. On the other \nhand, girls with TS who registered at older ages might not have \nbeen affected by this selection bias because the height difference \nTable 1.

In brief, taller \nTS patients are often diagnosed only in older ages. To solve \nthis problem, data for relatively tall TS girls during infancy was \nneeded. To address this issue, we utilized semilongitudinal data \nfor girls with TS diagnosed at older ages. As the Foundation \ndatabase only included 3 consecutive years of data prior to GH \ntreatment, we could not obtain enough data from this source. \nTherefore, we collected new longitudinal data from the medical \nrecords of 205 girls with TS who sought treatment at 2 major \nhospitals in Tokyo (the National Center for Child Health and \nDevelopment and Toranomon Hospital) and used these data \nfor the revision of the growth charts. From the 2 datasets, 2,072 \nsubjects (born from 1970 to 2006, median 1985) were available. \nAfter excluding individuals who lacked the typical TS karyotype \n(n=31), those with spontaneous puberty (n=144), unknown \npuberty at the time of height and weight measurement (n=14), \na history of growth-promoting treatment (n=264), measured \nvalues exceeding \u00b15 standard deviation (SD) in the study \npopulation (n=4), and duplicate registration (n=50), 1,565 \nsubjects were retained for analysis. The presence of puberty was \njudged by statements in the application form (for Foundation \ndata) or the attainment of Tanner 2 breast development \n(for hospital data). Of the 5,796 measurements from 1,565 \nsubjects before growth-promoting treatment, an additional \n24 measurements were excluded because they fell outside \nthe range of \u00b15 SD of the population mean. New TS-specific \ngrowth charts were then constructed from the remaining 5,772 \nmeasurements using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nBased on the new TS-specific growth chart, the mean height \nof an adult female with TS is 141.3\u00b15.6 cm, which is comparable \nto data from other Japanese TS samples (e.g., 143.0\u00b14.9 cm, 18 \nTS females without GH treatment)\n26). According to the chart, \nindividuals with TS at the age of 20 years are, on average, -3.30 \nSD below the mean height for the normal population, which \nis similar to data from foreign countries (-2.54 to -4.15 SD)\n14). \nThese findings support the validity of the new TS-specific \ngrowth chart.\nGirls with TS with spontaneous puberty are significantly \ntaller than those without spontaneous puberty at the age of \n\u226512 years, but the difference is no longer significant when \nthey reach their adult height\n22). Thus, 2 types of growth charts \nmay be necessary during the peripubertal period. However, \nwe only produced TS-specific growth charts for girls without \nspontaneous puberty due to the limited number of pubertal \nsubjects. Nevertheless, when we plotted the measurements from \n144 subjects with spontaneous puberty on the new charts, all \nexcept for 5 measurements were distributed within \u00b12 SD. This \nfinding suggests that the new TS-specific growth charts can be \nused for girls with TS with spontaneous puberty.\nThrough these processes, new TS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese girls were constructed\n8). We believe that the new TS-\nspecific charts can be presumed to be representative of growth \nin girls with TS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practices. In \naddition, these charts are the only TS-specific growth charts \nbased on an Asian population.\nDevelopment of growth charts in NS\nNS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome \nwith an estimated incidence of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 \nlive births\n27-29). The cardinal features of NS are distinctive facial \ncharacteristics that change with age, short stature, congenital \nheart disease, and chest deformity\n27,30). Clinical features of NS \ncan vary within a family, but become more subtle in adult life\n31). \nIndividuals with NS are typically treated by a multidisciplinary \nteam of specialists, which includes pediatric geneticists, \npediatric cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists.\nThe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling \npathway is an essential signaling pathway that controls cell \nproliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein-\ntyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene, \nwhich encodes a tyrosine phosphatase protein involved in \nthe Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, was identified as the first \ncausative gene in NS patients\n32). Increasing evidence indicates \nthat germline mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK \nsignaling pathway cause NS and Noonan-related syndrome\n33). \nWhile mutations in such genes have been identified in \napproximately 60%\u201370% of patients with NS\n34,35), the diagnosis \nof NS remains clinical\n27,36). Several scoring systems are currently \navailable for diagnosis, with the scoring system developed by \nvan der Burgt et al.\n37) in 1994 being the most widely used.\nGrowth patterns of children with NS are different from \nthose of the normal population. The mean birth length is \nslightly shorter, but within the normal range. However, a rapid \ndecline in length/height SD score (SDS) relative to the normal \npopulation develops during the first year of life. Thereafter, \nmean length/height lies approximately on the -2.5 SD line for \nthe normal population until age 12 years in boys and 10.5 years \nin girls. Afterwards, further decline becomes obvious due to \ndelayed puberty, and then the height SDS relative to the normal \npopulation tends to recover.\nNS-specific growth curves are currently available for 4 regions: \nBrazil, Europe, North America, and Japan\n9,10,38-40). Undoubtedly, \nNS-specific charts should be developed with data collected by \nmultidisciplinary specialists. Therefore, when we constructed \nNS-specific growth charts\n9,10), we conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of pediatric geneticists, pediatric cardiologists, and \npediatric endocrinologists responsible for Japanese NS patients. \nWe collaborated with three academic societies (i.e., The Japan \nSociety of Pediatric Genetics, The Japanese Society of Pediatric \nCardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and The Japanese Society for \nPediatric Endocrinology) and gathered data for NS patients \ndiagnosed by specialists from these societies at 31 hospitals \nnationwide. Due to secular trends in height, we recruited \npatients born in 1970 or later\n7). Questionnaires that included \nauxological measurements together with a minimal set of \nclinical and genetic data were sent to these hospitals. Height and \nweight measurements were gathered in a mixed longitudinal \nand cross-sectional manner. The minimal interval between 2 \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n243\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\nmeasurements was 1 month when the subjects were measured \nbefore 1 year of age or 3 months when measured after 1 year of \nage.\nTwenty of the 31 hospitals responded to our questionnaire, \nresulting in data for 356 clinically diagnosed NS patients. A total \nof 48 subjects were excluded because of missing auxological \ndata (n=26), presence of complications that might have affected \ngrowth (n=5), or extreme longitudinal growth aberrations \u00b13 \nSD from the mean (n=17). The remaining 308 subjects (159 \nboys, 149 girls) were analyzed. To develop the growth charts, \n3,249 measurements (boys, 1,674; girls, 1,575) were included \nafter exclusion of 23 measurements from three outliers. Height \nSDSs were not significantly different between individuals with \nand without genetic analysis (difference, 0.076; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.020 to 0.17; P=0.12). NS-specific growth charts \nwere constructed using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nSubjects were diagnosed with NS by certified specialists, \nand thus, diagnoses were very reliable. Moreover, diagnosis \nwas further validated by the scoring system developed by van \nder Burgt et al.\n37). All measurements were properly selected \nby excluding individuals with previous growth-promoting \ntreatment, complications that may affect growth, and extreme \nlongitudinal growth aberrations. Based on the NS-specific \ngrowth charts, adult height is 157.3\u00b17.4 cm for males (-2.3\u00b11.3 \nSDS) and 146.8\u00b16.9 cm for females (-2.1\u00b11.3 SDS). These adult \nheight SDSs for the normal population are comparable to values \nreported in other countries (male, -2.5 to -1.4; female, -2.2 to \n-1.8)\n38-42).\nThrough these processes, NS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese individuals were constructed\n9,10). We believe that \nthese charts can be presumed to be representative of growth in \nindividuals with NS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practice. \nMoreover, these are the only NS-specific growth charts based on \nmeasurements from an Asian population.\nStatistical method used for developing \ngrowth charts\nThe lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method\n43) was used for the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese \nindividuals with TS and NS. The LMS method is a standard \nmethod for establishing growth charts\n44) and is effective at \nconstructing reference charts that show the distribution of \na measurement as it changes by covariates such as age and \ntime. The LMS method includes smoothing with a spline \nfunction after normalizing age-specific data using a power \ntransformation. In this method, the degree of skewness (L), \nmedian (M), and coefficient of variation (S) are estimated by \nage, and SD scores (Z-scores) of each index can be calculated \nfrom the L, M, and S values. This method also allows the \ncalculation of percentiles, as SD scores can be converted to \npercentiles in a normal distribution. The LMS method is usually \nused for establishing growth charts based on cross-sectional \ndata. However, it can also be used for establishing growth \ncharts based on longitudinal data when the measurements are \nwidely scattered and there are no subjects with a nonnegligible \ninfluence on the charts\n9,45). In the data used for development of \ndisease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with TS \nand NS, numerous measurements were scattered across the age \nrange and all subjects had a significant influence on the growth \ncharts.\nDiscussion\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, it is essential \nto collect anthropometric measurements that reflect the true \ndisease population. Therefore, we made maximal efforts to \nobtain unbiased data for subjects with TS and NS that were \nrepresentative of overall TS and NS populations in Japan. Table \n2 summarizes the characteristics considered in the development \nof disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with \nTS and NS. For TS, we first utilized an existing nationwide \ncohort of TS patients before GH treatment in Japan. However, \nthis cohort did not represent the true population of TS due \nto diagnosis bias. To overcome this significant selection bias, \nwe compiled new hospital data in addition to the cohort data \nand analyzed both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. \nThese efforts have made the TS-specific charts closer to the \ntrue TS standards. For NS, there was not an existing cohort with \nanthropometric data. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide \nquestionnaire survey of multidisciplinary specialists, as NS is a \nclinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. As diagnosis \nof NS can be difficult, it was essential to have reliable diagnoses. \nTo do so, we only compiled data for subjects diagnosed by \ncertified specialists and validated the diagnosis using the \nscoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.\n37). Although \nthese efforts may not be perfect, we believe that the collected \nTable 2.

As the population of Japan is generally considered \nethnically homogeneous, we did not need to consider ethnicity \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. Theoretically, \nlocal TS and NS-specific growth charts would be most suitable \nfor individual growth monitoring in different countries. \nHowever, developing these charts can be difficult. It is of note \nthat there are no other disease-specific growth charts in TS and \nNS for Asian populations except for our charts. If our charts \nare used for other Asian populations, physicians should bear in \nmind how growth patterns in their countries differ from those \nin Japanese. For example, if our charts were utilized by Korean \nphysicians, they should know the difference in growth patterns \nbetween the two countries. Fig. 1 shows growth charts of the \nnormal Japanese population\n46) superimposed on the normal \nKorean population\n47). As the figure shows, there is considerable \noverlap except for younger and pubertal ages. Therefore, our TS \nand NS-specific growth charts might be applicable as long as \nphysicians are aware of the different growth patterns between \ntwo countries in the general population.\nConclusions\nDisease-specific growth charts are very useful tools. Theoreti\u00ad\ncally, these charts should be constructed for each ethnic group. \nHowever, gathering unbiased subject measurements is very \nchallenging. Here, we reviewed the development of disease-\nspecific charts for Japanese individuals with TS and NS. When \nusing disease-specific charts developed using data from other \nethnic groups, physicians should consider the underlying \ndifferences in normal growth patterns between ethnic groups.\nConflict of interest\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was \nreported.\nReferences \n1.\t\nHermanussen M.

As the growth patterns of affected \nindividuals differ from those of normal populations, it is challenging to detect \nadditional conditions that can influence growth using standard growth charts. \nDisease-specific growth charts are thus very useful tools and can be helpful for \nunderstanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis of congenital diseases. In \naddition, disease-specific growth charts allow doctors to detect deviations from \nthe usual growth patterns for early diagnosis of an additional condition and can \nbe used to evaluate the effects of growth-promoting treatment for patients. When \ndeveloping these charts, factors that can affect the reliability of the charts should \nbe considered. These factors include the definition of the disease with growth \nfailure, selection bias in the measurements used to develop the charts, secular \ntrends of the subjects, the numbers of subjects of varying ages and ethnicities, and \nthe statistical method used to develop the charts. In this review, we summarize the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with Turner \nsyndrome and Noonan syndrome and evaluate the efforts to collect unbiased \nmeasurements of subjects with these diseases. These charts were the only available \ndisease-specific growth charts of Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome for Asian \npopulations and were developed using a Japanese population. Therefore, when \nthese charts are adopted for Asian populations other than Japanese, different \ngrowth patterns should be considered. \nKeywords: Growth charts, Disease-specific growth chart, Turner syndrome, Noonan \nsyndrome, LMS method, Asian population\nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\n1,\nSusumu Yokoya, MD, PhD\n2\n1Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, \nTokyo, \n2Fukushima Global Medical \nScience Center, Fukushima Medical \nUniversity, Fukushima, Japan\nhttps://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.4.240\nAnn Pediatr Endocrinol Metab 2017;22:240-246\n\u00a92017 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism\nReceived: 12 December, 2017\nAccepted: 18 December, 2017\nAddress for correspondence: \nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, 2-11-\n1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-8606, \nJapan\nTel: +81-3-3964-1211\nFax: +81-3-3579-8212\nE-mail: isojimat-tky@umin.ac.jp\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-0011-\n0325\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nISSN: 2287-1012(Print) \nISSN: 2287-1292(Online) \nIntroduction\nGrowth charts are vital tools used worldwide for evaluating the growth of children in clinical \nsettings as well as public health examinations\n1,2). These charts enable physicians to compare the \ngrowth of an individual with that of the general population, assessing whether the individual \nhas growth failure or not. Starting with such assessment, a physician can investigate a specific \ndiagnosis for an individual with growth failure, although the diagnosis is usually determined \nby other findings such as clinical features, hormone levels, karyotyping, or bone radiographs.\nMany congenital diseases are associated with growth failure, and patients with these diseases \nshow characteristic growth patterns. As the growth patterns of affected individuals differ \nfrom those of the normal population, it is challenging to detect additional conditions that \ninfluence their growth using growth charts for the normal population. In clinical settings, it is \nessential for physicians to consider other possible contributory factors besides the established \ndiagnosis. To that end, disease-specific growth charts are very useful and are necessary for \nseveral reasons\n3). First, they are helpful for understanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis \nof a disease. Second, they enable the detection of deviations from typical growth patterns in \n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n241\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\naffected individuals and aid in early diagnosis of additional \nconditions. Finally, they are very useful for evaluating the \neffects of growth-promoting treatment among patients. At \npresent, disease-specific growth charts are available for several \nsyndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, \nWilliams syndrome, Turner syndrome (TS), and Noonan \nsyndrome (NS)\n4-10).\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, we should \nconsider several factors that may affect the reliability of the \ncharts (Table 1). First, we should determine if the disease with \ngrowth failure can be precisely defined. If the pathogenesis \nor etiology of the disease is ambiguous, we cannot admit the \nsignificance of disease-specific growth charts. Second, we should \navoid selection bias in subject measurements whenever possible. \nIt often occurs that subjects recruited for measurements are not \nrepresentative of the overall disease population, as diagnoses \nare usually made after many symptoms manifest. Therefore, it \nis possible that the sample used for measurements is biased by \ndelayed diagnosis of the disease, and if we analyzed only cross-\nsectional data, the developed disease-specific growth charts \nmay show biased and different growth patterns. This will be \ndiscussed later in the example on the development of growth \ncharts in TS. Additional selection bias may derive from the \nspecialties of the physicians seeing the patients, which will be \ndiscussed later in the example of the development of growth \ncharts in NS. Briefly, in clinically heterogeneous disease such \nas NS where many specialists are involved in care, subject \nmeasurements should be obtained from multidisciplinary \nspecialists. In addition, the rearing environment of the subjects \nmay cause selection bias. Third, we should consider secular \ntrends among subjects when gathering data. For rare diseases, \nit can be difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients. \nTherefore, we tend to recruit subjects over many years, which \ncan cause the developed disease-specific growth charts to be \naffected by secular growth trends. Fourth, we should collect \nmeasurements from a sufficient number of patients of all ages \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. If insufficient \nsubjects are available in certain age categories, a bump or a \ndip will be observed in the growth charts, which reflects the \nsampling error that occurs with a small number of subjects. \nFifth, we should consider that ethnicity can influence the \ngrowth of children with a disease. Finally, we should analyze \nprecise anthropometric data using proper statistical methods. \nConsidering all these factors, it seems almost impossible to \ncollect ideal data to establish true disease-specific standards. \nHowever, is it necessary to do so because disease-specific growth \nreferences remain meaningful tools for physicians in various \nclinical settings\n3). In this review, we summarize our experiences \ndeveloping disease-specific growth charts in TS\n8) and NS\n9,10).\nDevelopment of growth charts in TS\nTS is a chromosomal disorder occurring in females that is \ncharacterized by short stature and primary ovarian failure. It is \nthe most common chromosomal disorder in females, and the \nincidence is estimated at 1 in 1,500\u20132,500 live births\n11-13). TS is \ndefined by a karyotype that contains a cell line of monosomy \nlacking at least the distal major part of the short arm of one X \nchromosome. The growth patterns of TS girls are different from \nthose of normal individuals\n11-13). The birth length in TS is smaller \nthan that in normal populations due to mild growth delay in \nutero. After birth, the growth velocity gradually declines. The \nlength/height of girls with TS often remains within the normal \nrange during infancy, but usually falls below the fifth percentile \nof the normal population by the age of 5 years. Growth failure is \nmore evident as girls become mature, and growth spurts are not \nobserved during the expected pubertal period. Untreated adults \nwith TS are reported to be approximately 20 cm shorter than \nnormal female adults\n14).\nTS-specific growth charts are available in many coun\u00ad\ntries\n8,15-23). In Japan, the first TS-specific growth charts were \ndeveloped by Suwa\n20) in 1992. These charts were constructed \nusing data from 704 girls with TS (6,255 measurements) born \nfrom 1955 to 1989 (median unknown), meaning that most of \nthe analyzed subjects were born in 1972 or earlier. As the secular \ntrend of increasing height among Japanese children reached a \nplateau around 1990\n7), the TS-specific growth charts developed \nby Suwa\n20) became inappropriate for the evaluation of girls \nrecently diagnosed with TS. Thus, revisions to the charts were \nnecessary.\nFor the development of revised TS-specific growth charts, we \nutilized a database from the Foundation for Growth Science\n24). \nThis database controls for the use of growth hormone (GH) \nthrough its registration system and contains pretreatment data \nfor TS patients across Japan. After data cleaning and analyzing \npretreatment data for girls with TS born in 1970 or later, cross-\nsectional growth charts were constructed\n7). However, there was \na problem that the growth charts were shifted downward in \nyounger ages, which seemed to be due to selection bias. Girls \nwith TS who registered with the Foundation during infancy \ntended to be smaller than those who registered beyond infancy, \nbecause the degree of height difference between girls with TS \nand the normal population was smaller in infancy. On the other \nhand, girls with TS who registered at older ages might not have \nbeen affected by this selection bias because the height difference \nTable 1.

In brief, taller \nTS patients are often diagnosed only in older ages. To solve \nthis problem, data for relatively tall TS girls during infancy was \nneeded. To address this issue, we utilized semilongitudinal data \nfor girls with TS diagnosed at older ages. As the Foundation \ndatabase only included 3 consecutive years of data prior to GH \ntreatment, we could not obtain enough data from this source. \nTherefore, we collected new longitudinal data from the medical \nrecords of 205 girls with TS who sought treatment at 2 major \nhospitals in Tokyo (the National Center for Child Health and \nDevelopment and Toranomon Hospital) and used these data \nfor the revision of the growth charts. From the 2 datasets, 2,072 \nsubjects (born from 1970 to 2006, median 1985) were available. \nAfter excluding individuals who lacked the typical TS karyotype \n(n=31), those with spontaneous puberty (n=144), unknown \npuberty at the time of height and weight measurement (n=14), \na history of growth-promoting treatment (n=264), measured \nvalues exceeding \u00b15 standard deviation (SD) in the study \npopulation (n=4), and duplicate registration (n=50), 1,565 \nsubjects were retained for analysis. The presence of puberty was \njudged by statements in the application form (for Foundation \ndata) or the attainment of Tanner 2 breast development \n(for hospital data). Of the 5,796 measurements from 1,565 \nsubjects before growth-promoting treatment, an additional \n24 measurements were excluded because they fell outside \nthe range of \u00b15 SD of the population mean. New TS-specific \ngrowth charts were then constructed from the remaining 5,772 \nmeasurements using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nBased on the new TS-specific growth chart, the mean height \nof an adult female with TS is 141.3\u00b15.6 cm, which is comparable \nto data from other Japanese TS samples (e.g., 143.0\u00b14.9 cm, 18 \nTS females without GH treatment)\n26). According to the chart, \nindividuals with TS at the age of 20 years are, on average, -3.30 \nSD below the mean height for the normal population, which \nis similar to data from foreign countries (-2.54 to -4.15 SD)\n14). \nThese findings support the validity of the new TS-specific \ngrowth chart.\nGirls with TS with spontaneous puberty are significantly \ntaller than those without spontaneous puberty at the age of \n\u226512 years, but the difference is no longer significant when \nthey reach their adult height\n22). Thus, 2 types of growth charts \nmay be necessary during the peripubertal period. However, \nwe only produced TS-specific growth charts for girls without \nspontaneous puberty due to the limited number of pubertal \nsubjects. Nevertheless, when we plotted the measurements from \n144 subjects with spontaneous puberty on the new charts, all \nexcept for 5 measurements were distributed within \u00b12 SD. This \nfinding suggests that the new TS-specific growth charts can be \nused for girls with TS with spontaneous puberty.\nThrough these processes, new TS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese girls were constructed\n8). We believe that the new TS-\nspecific charts can be presumed to be representative of growth \nin girls with TS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practices. In \naddition, these charts are the only TS-specific growth charts \nbased on an Asian population.\nDevelopment of growth charts in NS\nNS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome \nwith an estimated incidence of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 \nlive births\n27-29). The cardinal features of NS are distinctive facial \ncharacteristics that change with age, short stature, congenital \nheart disease, and chest deformity\n27,30). Clinical features of NS \ncan vary within a family, but become more subtle in adult life\n31). \nIndividuals with NS are typically treated by a multidisciplinary \nteam of specialists, which includes pediatric geneticists, \npediatric cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists.\nThe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling \npathway is an essential signaling pathway that controls cell \nproliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein-\ntyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene, \nwhich encodes a tyrosine phosphatase protein involved in \nthe Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, was identified as the first \ncausative gene in NS patients\n32). Increasing evidence indicates \nthat germline mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK \nsignaling pathway cause NS and Noonan-related syndrome\n33). \nWhile mutations in such genes have been identified in \napproximately 60%\u201370% of patients with NS\n34,35), the diagnosis \nof NS remains clinical\n27,36). Several scoring systems are currently \navailable for diagnosis, with the scoring system developed by \nvan der Burgt et al.\n37) in 1994 being the most widely used.\nGrowth patterns of children with NS are different from \nthose of the normal population. The mean birth length is \nslightly shorter, but within the normal range. However, a rapid \ndecline in length/height SD score (SDS) relative to the normal \npopulation develops during the first year of life. Thereafter, \nmean length/height lies approximately on the -2.5 SD line for \nthe normal population until age 12 years in boys and 10.5 years \nin girls. Afterwards, further decline becomes obvious due to \ndelayed puberty, and then the height SDS relative to the normal \npopulation tends to recover.\nNS-specific growth curves are currently available for 4 regions: \nBrazil, Europe, North America, and Japan\n9,10,38-40). Undoubtedly, \nNS-specific charts should be developed with data collected by \nmultidisciplinary specialists. Therefore, when we constructed \nNS-specific growth charts\n9,10), we conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of pediatric geneticists, pediatric cardiologists, and \npediatric endocrinologists responsible for Japanese NS patients. \nWe collaborated with three academic societies (i.e., The Japan \nSociety of Pediatric Genetics, The Japanese Society of Pediatric \nCardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and The Japanese Society for \nPediatric Endocrinology) and gathered data for NS patients \ndiagnosed by specialists from these societies at 31 hospitals \nnationwide. Due to secular trends in height, we recruited \npatients born in 1970 or later\n7). Questionnaires that included \nauxological measurements together with a minimal set of \nclinical and genetic data were sent to these hospitals. Height and \nweight measurements were gathered in a mixed longitudinal \nand cross-sectional manner. The minimal interval between 2 \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n243\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\nmeasurements was 1 month when the subjects were measured \nbefore 1 year of age or 3 months when measured after 1 year of \nage.\nTwenty of the 31 hospitals responded to our questionnaire, \nresulting in data for 356 clinically diagnosed NS patients. A total \nof 48 subjects were excluded because of missing auxological \ndata (n=26), presence of complications that might have affected \ngrowth (n=5), or extreme longitudinal growth aberrations \u00b13 \nSD from the mean (n=17). The remaining 308 subjects (159 \nboys, 149 girls) were analyzed. To develop the growth charts, \n3,249 measurements (boys, 1,674; girls, 1,575) were included \nafter exclusion of 23 measurements from three outliers. Height \nSDSs were not significantly different between individuals with \nand without genetic analysis (difference, 0.076; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.020 to 0.17; P=0.12). NS-specific growth charts \nwere constructed using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nSubjects were diagnosed with NS by certified specialists, \nand thus, diagnoses were very reliable. Moreover, diagnosis \nwas further validated by the scoring system developed by van \nder Burgt et al.\n37). All measurements were properly selected \nby excluding individuals with previous growth-promoting \ntreatment, complications that may affect growth, and extreme \nlongitudinal growth aberrations. Based on the NS-specific \ngrowth charts, adult height is 157.3\u00b17.4 cm for males (-2.3\u00b11.3 \nSDS) and 146.8\u00b16.9 cm for females (-2.1\u00b11.3 SDS). These adult \nheight SDSs for the normal population are comparable to values \nreported in other countries (male, -2.5 to -1.4; female, -2.2 to \n-1.8)\n38-42).\nThrough these processes, NS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese individuals were constructed\n9,10). We believe that \nthese charts can be presumed to be representative of growth in \nindividuals with NS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practice. \nMoreover, these are the only NS-specific growth charts based on \nmeasurements from an Asian population.\nStatistical method used for developing \ngrowth charts\nThe lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method\n43) was used for the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese \nindividuals with TS and NS. The LMS method is a standard \nmethod for establishing growth charts\n44) and is effective at \nconstructing reference charts that show the distribution of \na measurement as it changes by covariates such as age and \ntime. The LMS method includes smoothing with a spline \nfunction after normalizing age-specific data using a power \ntransformation. In this method, the degree of skewness (L), \nmedian (M), and coefficient of variation (S) are estimated by \nage, and SD scores (Z-scores) of each index can be calculated \nfrom the L, M, and S values. This method also allows the \ncalculation of percentiles, as SD scores can be converted to \npercentiles in a normal distribution. The LMS method is usually \nused for establishing growth charts based on cross-sectional \ndata. However, it can also be used for establishing growth \ncharts based on longitudinal data when the measurements are \nwidely scattered and there are no subjects with a nonnegligible \ninfluence on the charts\n9,45). In the data used for development of \ndisease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with TS \nand NS, numerous measurements were scattered across the age \nrange and all subjects had a significant influence on the growth \ncharts.\nDiscussion\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, it is essential \nto collect anthropometric measurements that reflect the true \ndisease population. Therefore, we made maximal efforts to \nobtain unbiased data for subjects with TS and NS that were \nrepresentative of overall TS and NS populations in Japan. Table \n2 summarizes the characteristics considered in the development \nof disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with \nTS and NS. For TS, we first utilized an existing nationwide \ncohort of TS patients before GH treatment in Japan. However, \nthis cohort did not represent the true population of TS due \nto diagnosis bias. To overcome this significant selection bias, \nwe compiled new hospital data in addition to the cohort data \nand analyzed both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. \nThese efforts have made the TS-specific charts closer to the \ntrue TS standards. For NS, there was not an existing cohort with \nanthropometric data. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide \nquestionnaire survey of multidisciplinary specialists, as NS is a \nclinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. As diagnosis \nof NS can be difficult, it was essential to have reliable diagnoses. \nTo do so, we only compiled data for subjects diagnosed by \ncertified specialists and validated the diagnosis using the \nscoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.\n37). Although \nthese efforts may not be perfect, we believe that the collected \nTable 2.

As the population of Japan is generally considered \nethnically homogeneous, we did not need to consider ethnicity \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. Theoretically, \nlocal TS and NS-specific growth charts would be most suitable \nfor individual growth monitoring in different countries. \nHowever, developing these charts can be difficult. It is of note \nthat there are no other disease-specific growth charts in TS and \nNS for Asian populations except for our charts. If our charts \nare used for other Asian populations, physicians should bear in \nmind how growth patterns in their countries differ from those \nin Japanese. For example, if our charts were utilized by Korean \nphysicians, they should know the difference in growth patterns \nbetween the two countries. Fig. 1 shows growth charts of the \nnormal Japanese population\n46) superimposed on the normal \nKorean population\n47). As the figure shows, there is considerable \noverlap except for younger and pubertal ages. Therefore, our TS \nand NS-specific growth charts might be applicable as long as \nphysicians are aware of the different growth patterns between \ntwo countries in the general population.\nConclusions\nDisease-specific growth charts are very useful tools. Theoreti\u00ad\ncally, these charts should be constructed for each ethnic group. \nHowever, gathering unbiased subject measurements is very \nchallenging. Here, we reviewed the development of disease-\nspecific charts for Japanese individuals with TS and NS. When \nusing disease-specific charts developed using data from other \nethnic groups, physicians should consider the underlying \ndifferences in normal growth patterns between ethnic groups.\nConflict of interest\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was \nreported.\nReferences \n1.\t\nHermanussen M.

Thun, MD, MS\nABSTRACT\nEach year, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates the number of new\ncancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the\nmost recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from\nthe National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North\nAmerican Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center\nfor Health Statistics. This report considers incidence data through 2003 and mortality data\nthrough 2004. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million\npopulation. A total of 1,444,920 new cancer cases and 559,650 deaths for cancers are pro-\njected to occur in the United States in 2007. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality\nrates include stabilization of the age-standardized, delay-adjusted incidence rates for all can-\ncers combined in men from 1995 through 2003; a continuing increase in the incidence rate by\n0.3% per year in women; and a 13.6% total decrease in age-standardized cancer death rates\namong men and women combined between 1991 and 2004. This report also examines cancer\nincidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year,\nas well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall trends. While the absolute\nnumber of cancer deaths decreased for the second consecutive year in the United States (by\nmore than 3,000 from 2003 to 2004) and much progress has been made in reducing mortality\nrates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in per-\nsons under age 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries\nand by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population. (CA\nCancer J Clin 2007;57:43\u201366.) \u00a9 American Cancer Society, Inc., 2007.\nINTRODUCTION\nCancer is a major public health problem in the United States and other developed countries. Currently, one in\nfour deaths in the United States is due to cancer. In this article, we provide an overview of cancer statistics, includ-\ning updated incidence, mortality, and survival rates, and expected number of new cancer cases and deaths in 2007.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nData Sources\nMortality data from 1930 to 2004 in the United States were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS).1 Incidence data for long-term trends (1975 to 2003), 5-year relative survival rates, and data on lifetime\nprobability of developing cancer were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) pro-\ngram of the National Cancer Institute, covering about 26% of the US population.2,3,4,5 Incidence data (1995 to 2003)\nfor projecting new cancer cases were obtained from cancer registries that participate in the SEER program or the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2019s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), through the\nNorth American Associations of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). State-speci\ufb01c incidence rates were abstracted\nDr. Jemal is Strategic Director, Cancer\nOccurrence, Department of Epidemi-\nology and Surveillance Research,\nAmerican Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.\nMs. Siegel is Manager, Surveillance\nInformation Services, Department of\nEpidemiology and Surveillance Re-\nsearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nDr. Ward is Managing Director, Sur-\nveillance Research, Department of\nEpidemiology and Surveillance Re-\nsearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nMr. Murray is Manager, Surveillance\nData Systems, Department of Epidem-\niology and Surveillance Research,\nAmerican Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.\nMr. Xu is Analyst, Mortality Statistics\nBranch, Division of Vital Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention, Hyattsville, MD.\nDr. Thun is Vice President, Depart-\nment of Epidemiology and Surveillance\nResearch, American Cancer Society,\nAtlanta, GA.\nThis article is available online at\nhttp://CAonline.AmCancerSoc.org\n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\nfrom Cancer in North America (1999\u20132003) Volume\nOne,6 based on data collected by cancer reg-\nistries participating in the SEER program and\nNPCR. Population data were obtained from the\nUS Census Bureau.7 Causes of death were coded\nand classified according to the International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD-8, ICD-9, and\nICD-10).8,9,10 Cancer cases were classi\ufb01ed accord-\ning to the International Classification of Diseases\nfor Oncology.11\nEstimated New Cancer Cases\nThe precise number of cancer cases diagnosed\neach year in the nation and in every state is un-\nknown because complete cancer registration has\nnot yet been achieved in some states. Since the\nAmerican Cancer Society (ACS) began produc-\ning estimates of new cancer cases in the current\nyear, the method has been re\ufb01ned several times\nto take advantage of improvements in data and\nstatistical methods. Beginning with 2007, we\nare using a new projection method described by\nPickle et al12 in an accompanying article in\nthis issue of CA. The new method is a spatio-\ntemporal model based on incidence data from\n1995 through 2003 from 41 states that met\nNAACCR\u2019s high-quality data standard for inci-\ndence, covering about 86% of the US popula-\ntion. This contrasts with the previous quadratic\nautoregressive model based on incidence data\nfrom the nine oldest SEER registries, covering\nabout 10% of the US population. Furthermore,\nthe new method considers geographic varia-\ntions in socio-demographic and lifestyle fac-\ntors, medical settings, and cancer screening\nbehaviors as predictors of incidence, and accounts\nfor expected delays in case reporting.\nEstimated Cancer Deaths\nWe used the state-space prediction method13\nto estimate the number of cancer deaths expected\nto occur in the United States and in each state\nin the year 2007. Projections are based on under-\nlying cause-of-death from death certificates as\nreported to the NCHS.1 This model projects\nthe number of cancer deaths expected to occur\nin 2007 based on the number that occurred each\nyear from 1969 to 2004 in the United States and\nin each state separately.\nOther Statistics\nWe provide mortality statistics for the lead-\ning causes of death as well as deaths from cancer\nin the year 2004. Causes of death for 2004 were\ncoded and classi\ufb01ed according to ICD-10.8 This\nreport also provides updated statistics on trends\nin cancer incidence and mortality rates, the prob-\nability of developing cancer, and 5-year relative\nsurvival rates for selected cancer sites based on data\nfrom 1975 through 2003.3 All age-adjusted inci-\ndence and death rates are standardized to the\n2000 US standard population and expressed per\n100,000 population.\nThe long-term incidence rates and trends\n(1975 to 2003) are adjusted for delays in report-\ning where possible. Delayed reporting affects the\nmost recent 1 to 3 years of incidence data (in\nthis case, 2001 to 2003), especially for cancers\nsuch as melanoma and prostate that are frequently\ndiagnosed in outpatient settings. The National\nCancer Institute (NCI) has developed a method\nto account for expected reporting delays in SEER\nregistries for all cancer sites combined and sev-\neral speci\ufb01c cancer sites when long-term inci-\ndence trends are analyzed.14 Delay-adjusted trends\nprovide a more accurate assessment of trends in\nthe most recent years for which data are available.\nSELECTED FINDINGS \nExpected Numbers of New Cancer Cases \nTable 1 presents estimated numbers of new\ncases of invasive cancer expected among men\nand women in the United States in 2007. The\noverall estimate of about 1.44 million new cases\ndoes not include carcinoma in situ of any site\nexcept urinary bladder, nor does it include basal\ncell and squamous cell cancers of the skin. More\nthan 1 million additional cases of basal cell and\nsquamous cell skin cancer, about 62,030 cases\nof breast carcinoma in situ, and 48,290 cases of\nin situ melanoma are expected to be newly diag-\nnosed in 2007. Because of the introduction of\na new projection method, estimates have been\naffected for many individual cancer sites, par-\nticularly for leukemia, female breast, lung, and\nprostate cancers. The estimated numbers of new\ncancer cases for each state and selected cancer\nsites are shown in Table 2.\nCancer Statistics, 2007\n44\nCA A Cancer Journal for Clinicians\n 15424863, 2007, 1, Downloaded from https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.57.1.43, Wiley Online Library on [06/02/2026].

It is estimated\nthat about 559,650 Americans will die from can-\ncer, corresponding to over 1,500 deaths per day.\nCancers of the lung and bronchus, prostate, and\ncolon and rectum in men, and cancers of the lung\nand bronchus, breast, and colon and rectum in\nwomen continue to be the most common fatal\ncancers. These four cancers account for half of\nthe total cancer deaths among men and women\n(Figure 1). Lung cancer surpassed breast cancer\nas the leading cause of cancer death in women in\n1987. Lung cancer is expected to account for 26%\nof all female cancer deaths in 2007. Table 3 pro-\nvides the estimated number of cancer deaths in\n2007 by state for selected cancer sites.\nRegional Variations in Cancer Rates\nTable 4 depicts cancer incidence for select\ncancers by state. Rates vary widely across states.\nFor example, among the cancers listed in Table\n4, the largest variations in the incidence rates,\nin proportionate terms, occurred in lung can-\ncer, in which rates (cases per 100,000 popula-\ntion) ranged from 41.8 in men and 21.5 in\nwomen in Utah to 137.9 in men and 73.5 in\nwomen in Kentucky. In contrast, the variation\nin female breast cancer incidence rates was small,\nranging from 115 cases per 100,000 population\nin New Mexico to 146.7 cases in Washington.\nFactors that contribute to the state variations in\nthe incidence rates include differences in the\nprevalence of risk factors, access to and utiliza-\ntion of early detection services, and complete-\nness of reporting. For example, the state variation\nin lung cancer incidence rates primarily re\ufb02ects\ndifferences in smoking prevalence; Utah ranks\nlowest in adult smoking prevalence and Kentucky\nhighest.\nTrends in Cancer Incidence and Mortality\nFigures 2 to 5 depict long-term trends in\ncancer incidence and death rates for all cancers\ncombined and for selected cancer sites by sex.\nTable 5 shows incidence and mortality patterns\nfor all cancer sites combined and for the four\nmost common cancer sites based on joinpoint\nanalysis. Trends in incidence were adjusted for\ndelayed reporting. Delay-adjusted cancer inci-\ndence rates for all sites combined stabilized in\nmen from 1995 to 2003 and increased in women\nby 0.3% per year from 1987 to 2003. \nLung cancer incidence rates are declining in\nmen and appear to be plateauing in women after\nincreasing for many decades. The lag in the tem-\nporal trend of lung cancer incidence rates in\nwomen compared with men reflects historical\ndifferences in cigarette smoking between men\nand women; cigarette smoking in women peaked\nabout 20 years later than in men. Colorectal can-\ncer incidence rates have decreased from 1998\nthrough 2003 in both males and in females. Female\nbreast cancer incidence rates leveled off from\n2001 to 2003 after increasing since 1980, which\nmay re\ufb02ect the saturation of mammography uti-\nlization and reduction in the use of hormone\nreplacement therapy.15 Prostate cancer incidence\nrates continued to increase, although at a slower\nrate than those reported for the early 1990s and\nbefore. The continuing increase for prostate can-\ncer may be attributable to increased screening\nthrough prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen (PSA) testing.15\nDeath rates for all cancer sites combined\ndecreased by 1.6% per year from 1993 to 2003\nin males and by 0.8% per year in females from\n1992 to 2003. Mortality rates have continued\nto decrease across all four major cancer sites in\nmen and in women, except for female lung can-\ncer in which rates continued to increase by 0.3%\nper year from 1995 to 2003 (Table 5).\nTable 6 shows the contribution of individual\ncancer sites to the total decrease in overall can-\ncer death rates. Death rates from all cancers com-\nbined peaked in 1990 for men and in 1991 for\nwomen. Between 1990/1991 and 2003, death\nrates from cancer decreased by 16.3% among men\nand by 8.5% among women. Among men, reduc-\ntion in death rates from lung, prostate, and colorec-\ntal cancers accounts for about 80% of the decrease\nin cancer death rates, while reduction in death\nrates from breast and colorectal cancers accounts\nfor over 60% of the decrease among women. Lung\ncancer in men and breast cancer in women alone\naccount for nearly 40% of the sex-speci\ufb01c decreases\nin cancer death rates. The decrease in lung can-\ncer death rates among men is due to reduction\nin tobacco use over the past 40 years, while the\ndecrease in death rates from female breast, col-\norectal, and prostate cancer largely re\ufb02ects improve-\nments in early detection and treatment.

African\nAmerican women have a 9% lower incidence rate,\nbut an 18% higher death rate than White women\nfor all cancer sites combined. For the speci\ufb01c can-\ncer sites listed in Table 11, incidence and death\nrates are consistently higher in African Americans\nthan in Whites, except for breast cancer (inci-\ndence) and lung and kidney cancers (incidence\nand mortality) among women. Death rates from\nprostate, stomach, and cervical cancers among\nAfrican Americans are more than twice those in\nWhites. Factors known to contribute to racial\ndisparities in mortality vary by cancer site. These\nfactors include differences in exposure to under-\nlying risk factors (eg, Helicobacter pylori for stom-\nach cancer), access to high-quality regular screening\n(breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers), and timely\ndiagnosis and treatment (for many cancers). The\nhigher breast cancer incidence rates among Whites\nare thought to re\ufb02ect a combination of factors\nthat affect diagnosis (such as more frequent mam-\nmography in White women until the most recent\ntime period) and those that affect disease risk\n(such as later age at \ufb01rst birth and greater use of\nhormone replacement therapy among White than\nAfrican American women).16\nAmong other racial and ethnic groups, can-\ncer incidence and death rates are lower than\n53\nVolume 57 \u2022 Number 1 \u2022 January/February 2007\nCA Cancer J Clin 2007;57:43\u201366\nFIGURE 4\nAnnual Age-adjusted Cancer Death Rates* Among Males for Selected Cancers, US, 1930 to 2003.\n*Rates are age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.

However, the incidence and\ndeath rates are generally higher in minority pop-\nulations than in Whites for cancers of the uter-\nine cervix, stomach, and liver. Stomach and liver\ncancer incidence and death rates are more than\ntwice as high in Asian American/Paci\ufb01c Islanders\nas in Whites, reflecting increased exposure to\ninfectious agents such as Helicobacter pylori and\nhepatitis B.17 Kidney cancer incidence and death\nrates are the highest among American Indians/\nAlaskan Natives, although factors that contribute\nto this are unknown.\nTrends in cancer incidence can only be\nadjusted for delayed reporting in Whites and\nAfrican Americans, and not in other racial and\nethnic subgroups, because long-term incidence\ndata required for delay adjustment are available\nonly for Whites and African Americans. From\n1995 to 2003, sex-specific incidence rates for\nall cancer sites combined, not adjusted for delayed\nreporting, have stabilized, except for African\nAmerican and Hispanic men, in whom rates\ndecreased by 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively.

However, because of the relatively\nearly age of breast cancer onset, women have a\nslightly higher probability of developing cancer\nbefore age 60 years. It is noteworthy that these esti-\nmates are based on the average experience of the\ngeneral population and may over- or underesti-\nmate individual risk because of differences in\nexposure and/or genetic susceptibility.\nCancer Survival by Race\nCompared with Whites, African American\nmen and women have poorer survival once a\ncancer diagnosis is made. As shown in Figure 7,\nAfrican Americans are less likely than Whites to\nbe diagnosed with cancer at a localized stage,\nwhen the disease may be more easily and suc-\ncessfully treated, and are more likely to be diag-\nnosed with cancer at a regional or distant stage of\ndisease. Five-year relative survival is lower in\nAfrican Americans than Whites within each stra-\ntum of stage of diagnosis for nearly every cancer\nsite (Figure 8). These disparities may result from\ninequalities in access to and receipt of quality\nhealth care and/or within-stage differences in\ntumor characteristics. The contribution of  these\nfactors, individually or collectively, to the differ-\nential survival for specific cancers is unclear.18\nHowever, some studies suggest that African\n55\nVolume 57 \u2022 Number 1 \u2022 January/February 2007\nCA Cancer J Clin 2007;57:43\u201366\nLine Segment 1\nLine Segment 2\nLine Segment 3\nLine Segment 4\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nYear\nAPC*\nAll sites\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1983\n0.9 \u2020\n1983-1992\n1.8 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-1.5\n1995-2003\n0.1\nMale\n1975-1989\n1.3 \u2020\n1989-1992\n5.1 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-4.5 \u2020\n1995-2003\n0.0\nFemale\n1975-1979\n-0.3\n1979-1987\n1.6 \u2020\n1987-2003\n0.3 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1990\n0.5 \u2020\n1990-1994\n-0.4\n1994-2003\n-1.1 \u2020\nMale  \n1975-1979\n1.0 \u2020\n1979-1990\n0.3 \u2020\n1990-1993\n-0.4\n1993-2003\n-1.6 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1992\n0.5 \u2020\n1992-2003\n-0.8 \u2020\nLung & bronchus\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1982\n2.5 \u2020\n1982-1991\n0.9 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-0.7 \u2020\nMale   \n1975-1982\n1.5 \u2020\n1982-1991\n-0.5 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-1.7 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1982\n5.6 \u2020\n1982-1991\n3.4 \u2020\n1991-2003\n0.5 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1980\n3.0 \u2020\n1980-1990\n1.8 \u2020\n1990-1994\n-0.1\n1994-2003\n-0.9 \u2020\nMale  \n1975-1978\n2.4 \u2020\n1978-1984\n1.2 \u2020\n1984-1991\n0.3 \u2020\n1991-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nFemale \n1975-1982\n6.0 \u2020\n1982-1990\n4.2 \u2020\n1990-1995\n1.7 \u2020\n1995-2003\n0.3 \u2020\nColon & rectum\nIncidence\nMale and female\n1975-1985\n0.8 \u2020\n1985-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.2\n1998-2003\n-2.1 \u2020\nMale    \n1975-1986\n1.1 \u2020\n1986-1995\n-2.1 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.0\n1998-2003\n-2.5 \u2020\nFemale  \n1975-1985\n0.3\n1985-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1998\n1.7\n1998-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nDeath\nMale and female\n1975-1978\n0.2\n1978-1985\n-0.8 \u2020\n1985-2001\n-1.8 \u2020\n2001-2003\n-2.8 \u2020\nMale   \n1975-1978\n0.8\n1978-1984\n-0.4\n1984-1990\n-1.3 \u2020\n1990-2003\n-2.1 \u2020\nFemale  \n1975-1984\n-1.0 \u2020\n1984-2003\n-1.9 \u2020\nBreast (female)\nIncidence\n1975-1980\n-0.4\n1980-1987\n3.7 \u2020\n1987-2001\n0.5 \u2020\n2001-2003\n-4.1\nDeath\n1975-1990\n0.4 \u2020\n1990-1995\n-1.8 \u2020\n1995-1999\n-3.1 \u2020\n1999-2003\n-1.4 \u2020\nProstate\nIncidence\n1975-1988\n2.6 \u2020\n1988-1992\n16.4 \u2020\n1992-1995\n-10.8 \u2020\n1995-2003\n1.1 \u2020\nDeath\n1975-1987\n0.9 \u2020\n1987-1991\n3.1 \u2020\n1991-1994\n-0.6\n1994-2003\n-4.0 \u2020\n*Annual percent change based on incidence (delay-adjusted) and mortality rates age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.\n\u2020The APC is significantly different from zero.\nNote: Trends were analyzed by Joinpoint Regression Program, version 3.1, with a maximum of three joinpoints (ie, four line segments).\nTABLE 5\nTrends in Cancer Incidence and Death Rates for Selected Cancers by Sex, US, 1975 to 2003\nSource: Ries LAG, Harkins D, Krapcho M, et al., eds.

This is true for both Whites and African\nAmericans. Cancers for which survival has not\nimproved substantially over the past 25 years\ninclude uterine corpus, cervix, larynx, lung,\nand pancreas.\nRelative survival rates cannot be calculated\nfor other racial and ethnic populations because\naccurate life expectancies (the average number\nof years of life remaining for persons who have\nattained a given age) are not available. However,\nbased on cause-speci\ufb01c survival rates of cancer\npatients diagnosed from 1992 to 2000 in SEER\nareas of the United States, all minority popula-\ntions, except Asian American/Pacific Islander\nwomen, have a greater probability of dying from\ncancer within 5 years of diagnosis than non-\nHispanic Whites, after accounting for differ-\nences in stage at diagnosis.15,20 For the four major\ncancer sites (prostate, female breast, lung and\nbronchus, and colon and rectum), minority pop-\nulations are more likely to be diagnosed at dis-\ntant stage, compared with non-Hispanic Whites.20\nCANCER IN CHILDREN\nCancer is the second leading cause of death\namong children between age 1 to 14 years in\nthe United States; accidents are the most fre-\nquent cause of death in this age group (Table\n14). The most common cancers in children (aged\n0 to 14 years) are leukemia (particularly acute\nlymphocytic leukemia), brain and other nerv-\nous system cancers, soft tissue sarcomas, non-\nHodgkin lymphoma, and renal (Wilms) tumors.3\nOver the past 25 years, there have been signi\ufb01-\ncant improvements in the 5-year relative sur-\nvival rate for many childhood cancers (Table 15).\nThe 5-year relative survival rate among children\nfor all cancer sites combined improved from 58%\nfor patients diagnosed in 1975 to 1977 to 79%\nfor those diagnosed in 1996 to 2002.3\n70 and\nBirth to\nBirth to 39\n40 to 59\n60 to 69\nOlder\nDeath\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\n(%)\nAll sites\u2020\nMale\n1.42 (1 in 70)\n8.69 (1 in 12)\n16.58 (1 in 6)\n39.44 (1 in 3)\n45.31 (1 in 2)\nFemale\n2.03 (1 in 49)\n9.09 (1 in 11)\n10.57 (1 in 9)\n26.60 (1 in 4)\n37.86 (1 in 3)\nUrinary bladder\nMale\n.02 (1 in 4381)\n.41 (1 in 241)\n.96 (1 in 105)\n3.41 (1 in 29)\n3.61 (1 in 28)\nFemale\n.01 (1 in 9527)\n.13 (1 in 782)\n.26 (1 in 379)\n.96 (1 in 105)\n1.14 (1 in 87)\nBreast\nFemale\n.48 (1 in 210)\n3.98 (1 in 25)\n3.65 (1 in 27)\n6.84 (1 in 15)\n12.67 (1 in 8)\nColon & rectum\nMale\n.07 (1 in 1342)\n.93 (1 in 107)\n1.67 (1 in 60)\n4.92 (1 in 20)\n5.79 (1 in 17)\nFemale\n.07 (1 in 1469)\n.73 (1 in 138)\n1.16 (1 in 86)\n4.45 (1 in 22)\n5.37 (1 in 19)\nLeukemia\nMale\n.16 (1 in 640)\n.22 (1 in 452)\n.35 (1 in 286)\n1.17 (1 in 86)\n1.49 (1 in 67)\nFemale\n.12 (1 in 820)\n.14 (1 in 694)\n.20 (1 in 491)\n.75 (1 in 132)\n1.05 (1 in 95)\nLung & bronchus\nMale\n.03 (1 in 3146)\n1.09 (1 in 92)\n2.61 (1 in 38)\n6.76 (1 in 15)\n8.02 (1 in 12)\nFemale\n.04 (1 in 2779)\n.85 (1 in 117)\n1.84 (1 in 54)\n4.52 (1 in 22)\n6.15 (1 in 16)\nMelanoma of the skin\nMale\n.13 (1 in 775)\n.53 (1 in 187)\n.56 (1 in 178)\n1.32 (1 in 76)\n2.04 (1 in 49)\nFemale\n.21 (1 in 467)\n.42 (1 in 237)\n.29 (1 in 347)\n.62 (1 in 163)\n1.38 (1 in 73)\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nMale\n.14 (1 in 735)\n.45 (1 in 222)\n.57 (1 in 176)\n1.56 (1 in 64)\n2.14 (1 in 47)\nFemale\n.08 (1 in 1200)\n.32 (1 in 313)\n.44 (1 in 229)\n1.30 (1 in 77)\n1.83 (1 in 55)\nProstate\nMale\n.01 (1 in 10373)\n2.59 (1 in 39)\n7.03 (1 in 14)\n13.83 (1 in 7)\n17.12 (1 in 6)\nUterine cervix\nFemale\n.16 (1 in 631)\n.29 (1 in 346)\n.14 (1 in 695)\n.20 (1 in 512)\n.73 (1 in 138)\nUterine corpus\nFemale\n.06 (1 in 1652)\n.70 (1 in 142)\n.81 (1 in 124)\n1.28 (1 in 78)\n2.49 (1 in 40)\n*For those free of cancer at beginning of age interval.

These estimates may vary con-\nsiderably from year to year, particularly for less\ncommon cancers and in states with smaller pop-\nulations. Unanticipated changes may occur that\nare not captured by modeling techniques.\nEstimates are also affected by changes in method.\nThe introduction of a new method for estimat-\ning new cancer cases in 2007 has substantially\naffected the estimates for a number of cancers,\nparticularly leukemia and female breast (see Pickle\net al for more detailed discussion).12 For these\nreasons, we discourage the use of these estimates\nto track year-to-year changes in cancer occurrence\nand death. Age-standardized or age-speci\ufb01c can-\ncer death rates from the NCHS and cancer inci-\ndence rates from SEER or NPCR are the\npreferred data sources for tracking cancer trends,\neven though these data are 3 and 4 years old,\nrespectively, by the time that they become avail-\nable. Despite their limitations, the ACS estimates\nof the number of new cancer cases and deaths\nin the current year provide reasonably accurate\nestimates of the burden of new cancer cases and\ndeaths in the United States. Such estimates will\nassist in continuing efforts to reduce the public\nhealth burden of cancer.\nREFERENCES\n1.

As the growth patterns of affected \nindividuals differ from those of normal populations, it is challenging to detect \nadditional conditions that can influence growth using standard growth charts. \nDisease-specific growth charts are thus very useful tools and can be helpful for \nunderstanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis of congenital diseases. In \naddition, disease-specific growth charts allow doctors to detect deviations from \nthe usual growth patterns for early diagnosis of an additional condition and can \nbe used to evaluate the effects of growth-promoting treatment for patients. When \ndeveloping these charts, factors that can affect the reliability of the charts should \nbe considered. These factors include the definition of the disease with growth \nfailure, selection bias in the measurements used to develop the charts, secular \ntrends of the subjects, the numbers of subjects of varying ages and ethnicities, and \nthe statistical method used to develop the charts. In this review, we summarize the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with Turner \nsyndrome and Noonan syndrome and evaluate the efforts to collect unbiased \nmeasurements of subjects with these diseases. These charts were the only available \ndisease-specific growth charts of Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome for Asian \npopulations and were developed using a Japanese population. Therefore, when \nthese charts are adopted for Asian populations other than Japanese, different \ngrowth patterns should be considered. \nKeywords: Growth charts, Disease-specific growth chart, Turner syndrome, Noonan \nsyndrome, LMS method, Asian population\nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\n1,\nSusumu Yokoya, MD, PhD\n2\n1Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, \nTokyo, \n2Fukushima Global Medical \nScience Center, Fukushima Medical \nUniversity, Fukushima, Japan\nhttps://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.4.240\nAnn Pediatr Endocrinol Metab 2017;22:240-246\n\u00a92017 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism\nReceived: 12 December, 2017\nAccepted: 18 December, 2017\nAddress for correspondence: \nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, 2-11-\n1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-8606, \nJapan\nTel: +81-3-3964-1211\nFax: +81-3-3579-8212\nE-mail: isojimat-tky@umin.ac.jp\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-0011-\n0325\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nISSN: 2287-1012(Print) \nISSN: 2287-1292(Online) \nIntroduction\nGrowth charts are vital tools used worldwide for evaluating the growth of children in clinical \nsettings as well as public health examinations\n1,2). These charts enable physicians to compare the \ngrowth of an individual with that of the general population, assessing whether the individual \nhas growth failure or not. Starting with such assessment, a physician can investigate a specific \ndiagnosis for an individual with growth failure, although the diagnosis is usually determined \nby other findings such as clinical features, hormone levels, karyotyping, or bone radiographs.\nMany congenital diseases are associated with growth failure, and patients with these diseases \nshow characteristic growth patterns. As the growth patterns of affected individuals differ \nfrom those of the normal population, it is challenging to detect additional conditions that \ninfluence their growth using growth charts for the normal population. In clinical settings, it is \nessential for physicians to consider other possible contributory factors besides the established \ndiagnosis. To that end, disease-specific growth charts are very useful and are necessary for \nseveral reasons\n3). First, they are helpful for understanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis \nof a disease. Second, they enable the detection of deviations from typical growth patterns in \n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n241\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\naffected individuals and aid in early diagnosis of additional \nconditions. Finally, they are very useful for evaluating the \neffects of growth-promoting treatment among patients. At \npresent, disease-specific growth charts are available for several \nsyndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, \nWilliams syndrome, Turner syndrome (TS), and Noonan \nsyndrome (NS)\n4-10).\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, we should \nconsider several factors that may affect the reliability of the \ncharts (Table 1). First, we should determine if the disease with \ngrowth failure can be precisely defined. If the pathogenesis \nor etiology of the disease is ambiguous, we cannot admit the \nsignificance of disease-specific growth charts. Second, we should \navoid selection bias in subject measurements whenever possible. \nIt often occurs that subjects recruited for measurements are not \nrepresentative of the overall disease population, as diagnoses \nare usually made after many symptoms manifest. Therefore, it \nis possible that the sample used for measurements is biased by \ndelayed diagnosis of the disease, and if we analyzed only cross-\nsectional data, the developed disease-specific growth charts \nmay show biased and different growth patterns. This will be \ndiscussed later in the example on the development of growth \ncharts in TS. Additional selection bias may derive from the \nspecialties of the physicians seeing the patients, which will be \ndiscussed later in the example of the development of growth \ncharts in NS. Briefly, in clinically heterogeneous disease such \nas NS where many specialists are involved in care, subject \nmeasurements should be obtained from multidisciplinary \nspecialists. In addition, the rearing environment of the subjects \nmay cause selection bias. Third, we should consider secular \ntrends among subjects when gathering data. For rare diseases, \nit can be difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients. \nTherefore, we tend to recruit subjects over many years, which \ncan cause the developed disease-specific growth charts to be \naffected by secular growth trends. Fourth, we should collect \nmeasurements from a sufficient number of patients of all ages \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. If insufficient \nsubjects are available in certain age categories, a bump or a \ndip will be observed in the growth charts, which reflects the \nsampling error that occurs with a small number of subjects. \nFifth, we should consider that ethnicity can influence the \ngrowth of children with a disease. Finally, we should analyze \nprecise anthropometric data using proper statistical methods. \nConsidering all these factors, it seems almost impossible to \ncollect ideal data to establish true disease-specific standards. \nHowever, is it necessary to do so because disease-specific growth \nreferences remain meaningful tools for physicians in various \nclinical settings\n3). In this review, we summarize our experiences \ndeveloping disease-specific growth charts in TS\n8) and NS\n9,10).\nDevelopment of growth charts in TS\nTS is a chromosomal disorder occurring in females that is \ncharacterized by short stature and primary ovarian failure. It is \nthe most common chromosomal disorder in females, and the \nincidence is estimated at 1 in 1,500\u20132,500 live births\n11-13). TS is \ndefined by a karyotype that contains a cell line of monosomy \nlacking at least the distal major part of the short arm of one X \nchromosome. The growth patterns of TS girls are different from \nthose of normal individuals\n11-13). The birth length in TS is smaller \nthan that in normal populations due to mild growth delay in \nutero. After birth, the growth velocity gradually declines. The \nlength/height of girls with TS often remains within the normal \nrange during infancy, but usually falls below the fifth percentile \nof the normal population by the age of 5 years. Growth failure is \nmore evident as girls become mature, and growth spurts are not \nobserved during the expected pubertal period. Untreated adults \nwith TS are reported to be approximately 20 cm shorter than \nnormal female adults\n14).\nTS-specific growth charts are available in many coun\u00ad\ntries\n8,15-23). In Japan, the first TS-specific growth charts were \ndeveloped by Suwa\n20) in 1992. These charts were constructed \nusing data from 704 girls with TS (6,255 measurements) born \nfrom 1955 to 1989 (median unknown), meaning that most of \nthe analyzed subjects were born in 1972 or earlier. As the secular \ntrend of increasing height among Japanese children reached a \nplateau around 1990\n7), the TS-specific growth charts developed \nby Suwa\n20) became inappropriate for the evaluation of girls \nrecently diagnosed with TS. Thus, revisions to the charts were \nnecessary.\nFor the development of revised TS-specific growth charts, we \nutilized a database from the Foundation for Growth Science\n24). \nThis database controls for the use of growth hormone (GH) \nthrough its registration system and contains pretreatment data \nfor TS patients across Japan. After data cleaning and analyzing \npretreatment data for girls with TS born in 1970 or later, cross-\nsectional growth charts were constructed\n7). However, there was \na problem that the growth charts were shifted downward in \nyounger ages, which seemed to be due to selection bias. Girls \nwith TS who registered with the Foundation during infancy \ntended to be smaller than those who registered beyond infancy, \nbecause the degree of height difference between girls with TS \nand the normal population was smaller in infancy. On the other \nhand, girls with TS who registered at older ages might not have \nbeen affected by this selection bias because the height difference \nTable 1.

In brief, taller \nTS patients are often diagnosed only in older ages. To solve \nthis problem, data for relatively tall TS girls during infancy was \nneeded. To address this issue, we utilized semilongitudinal data \nfor girls with TS diagnosed at older ages. As the Foundation \ndatabase only included 3 consecutive years of data prior to GH \ntreatment, we could not obtain enough data from this source. \nTherefore, we collected new longitudinal data from the medical \nrecords of 205 girls with TS who sought treatment at 2 major \nhospitals in Tokyo (the National Center for Child Health and \nDevelopment and Toranomon Hospital) and used these data \nfor the revision of the growth charts. From the 2 datasets, 2,072 \nsubjects (born from 1970 to 2006, median 1985) were available. \nAfter excluding individuals who lacked the typical TS karyotype \n(n=31), those with spontaneous puberty (n=144), unknown \npuberty at the time of height and weight measurement (n=14), \na history of growth-promoting treatment (n=264), measured \nvalues exceeding \u00b15 standard deviation (SD) in the study \npopulation (n=4), and duplicate registration (n=50), 1,565 \nsubjects were retained for analysis. The presence of puberty was \njudged by statements in the application form (for Foundation \ndata) or the attainment of Tanner 2 breast development \n(for hospital data). Of the 5,796 measurements from 1,565 \nsubjects before growth-promoting treatment, an additional \n24 measurements were excluded because they fell outside \nthe range of \u00b15 SD of the population mean. New TS-specific \ngrowth charts were then constructed from the remaining 5,772 \nmeasurements using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nBased on the new TS-specific growth chart, the mean height \nof an adult female with TS is 141.3\u00b15.6 cm, which is comparable \nto data from other Japanese TS samples (e.g., 143.0\u00b14.9 cm, 18 \nTS females without GH treatment)\n26). According to the chart, \nindividuals with TS at the age of 20 years are, on average, -3.30 \nSD below the mean height for the normal population, which \nis similar to data from foreign countries (-2.54 to -4.15 SD)\n14). \nThese findings support the validity of the new TS-specific \ngrowth chart.\nGirls with TS with spontaneous puberty are significantly \ntaller than those without spontaneous puberty at the age of \n\u226512 years, but the difference is no longer significant when \nthey reach their adult height\n22). Thus, 2 types of growth charts \nmay be necessary during the peripubertal period. However, \nwe only produced TS-specific growth charts for girls without \nspontaneous puberty due to the limited number of pubertal \nsubjects. Nevertheless, when we plotted the measurements from \n144 subjects with spontaneous puberty on the new charts, all \nexcept for 5 measurements were distributed within \u00b12 SD. This \nfinding suggests that the new TS-specific growth charts can be \nused for girls with TS with spontaneous puberty.\nThrough these processes, new TS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese girls were constructed\n8). We believe that the new TS-\nspecific charts can be presumed to be representative of growth \nin girls with TS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practices. In \naddition, these charts are the only TS-specific growth charts \nbased on an Asian population.\nDevelopment of growth charts in NS\nNS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome \nwith an estimated incidence of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 \nlive births\n27-29). The cardinal features of NS are distinctive facial \ncharacteristics that change with age, short stature, congenital \nheart disease, and chest deformity\n27,30). Clinical features of NS \ncan vary within a family, but become more subtle in adult life\n31). \nIndividuals with NS are typically treated by a multidisciplinary \nteam of specialists, which includes pediatric geneticists, \npediatric cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists.\nThe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling \npathway is an essential signaling pathway that controls cell \nproliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein-\ntyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene, \nwhich encodes a tyrosine phosphatase protein involved in \nthe Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, was identified as the first \ncausative gene in NS patients\n32). Increasing evidence indicates \nthat germline mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK \nsignaling pathway cause NS and Noonan-related syndrome\n33). \nWhile mutations in such genes have been identified in \napproximately 60%\u201370% of patients with NS\n34,35), the diagnosis \nof NS remains clinical\n27,36). Several scoring systems are currently \navailable for diagnosis, with the scoring system developed by \nvan der Burgt et al.\n37) in 1994 being the most widely used.\nGrowth patterns of children with NS are different from \nthose of the normal population. The mean birth length is \nslightly shorter, but within the normal range. However, a rapid \ndecline in length/height SD score (SDS) relative to the normal \npopulation develops during the first year of life. Thereafter, \nmean length/height lies approximately on the -2.5 SD line for \nthe normal population until age 12 years in boys and 10.5 years \nin girls. Afterwards, further decline becomes obvious due to \ndelayed puberty, and then the height SDS relative to the normal \npopulation tends to recover.\nNS-specific growth curves are currently available for 4 regions: \nBrazil, Europe, North America, and Japan\n9,10,38-40). Undoubtedly, \nNS-specific charts should be developed with data collected by \nmultidisciplinary specialists. Therefore, when we constructed \nNS-specific growth charts\n9,10), we conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of pediatric geneticists, pediatric cardiologists, and \npediatric endocrinologists responsible for Japanese NS patients. \nWe collaborated with three academic societies (i.e., The Japan \nSociety of Pediatric Genetics, The Japanese Society of Pediatric \nCardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and The Japanese Society for \nPediatric Endocrinology) and gathered data for NS patients \ndiagnosed by specialists from these societies at 31 hospitals \nnationwide. Due to secular trends in height, we recruited \npatients born in 1970 or later\n7). Questionnaires that included \nauxological measurements together with a minimal set of \nclinical and genetic data were sent to these hospitals. Height and \nweight measurements were gathered in a mixed longitudinal \nand cross-sectional manner. The minimal interval between 2 \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n243\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\nmeasurements was 1 month when the subjects were measured \nbefore 1 year of age or 3 months when measured after 1 year of \nage.\nTwenty of the 31 hospitals responded to our questionnaire, \nresulting in data for 356 clinically diagnosed NS patients. A total \nof 48 subjects were excluded because of missing auxological \ndata (n=26), presence of complications that might have affected \ngrowth (n=5), or extreme longitudinal growth aberrations \u00b13 \nSD from the mean (n=17). The remaining 308 subjects (159 \nboys, 149 girls) were analyzed. To develop the growth charts, \n3,249 measurements (boys, 1,674; girls, 1,575) were included \nafter exclusion of 23 measurements from three outliers. Height \nSDSs were not significantly different between individuals with \nand without genetic analysis (difference, 0.076; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.020 to 0.17; P=0.12). NS-specific growth charts \nwere constructed using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nSubjects were diagnosed with NS by certified specialists, \nand thus, diagnoses were very reliable. Moreover, diagnosis \nwas further validated by the scoring system developed by van \nder Burgt et al.\n37). All measurements were properly selected \nby excluding individuals with previous growth-promoting \ntreatment, complications that may affect growth, and extreme \nlongitudinal growth aberrations. Based on the NS-specific \ngrowth charts, adult height is 157.3\u00b17.4 cm for males (-2.3\u00b11.3 \nSDS) and 146.8\u00b16.9 cm for females (-2.1\u00b11.3 SDS). These adult \nheight SDSs for the normal population are comparable to values \nreported in other countries (male, -2.5 to -1.4; female, -2.2 to \n-1.8)\n38-42).\nThrough these processes, NS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese individuals were constructed\n9,10). We believe that \nthese charts can be presumed to be representative of growth in \nindividuals with NS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practice. \nMoreover, these are the only NS-specific growth charts based on \nmeasurements from an Asian population.\nStatistical method used for developing \ngrowth charts\nThe lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method\n43) was used for the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese \nindividuals with TS and NS. The LMS method is a standard \nmethod for establishing growth charts\n44) and is effective at \nconstructing reference charts that show the distribution of \na measurement as it changes by covariates such as age and \ntime. The LMS method includes smoothing with a spline \nfunction after normalizing age-specific data using a power \ntransformation. In this method, the degree of skewness (L), \nmedian (M), and coefficient of variation (S) are estimated by \nage, and SD scores (Z-scores) of each index can be calculated \nfrom the L, M, and S values. This method also allows the \ncalculation of percentiles, as SD scores can be converted to \npercentiles in a normal distribution. The LMS method is usually \nused for establishing growth charts based on cross-sectional \ndata. However, it can also be used for establishing growth \ncharts based on longitudinal data when the measurements are \nwidely scattered and there are no subjects with a nonnegligible \ninfluence on the charts\n9,45). In the data used for development of \ndisease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with TS \nand NS, numerous measurements were scattered across the age \nrange and all subjects had a significant influence on the growth \ncharts.\nDiscussion\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, it is essential \nto collect anthropometric measurements that reflect the true \ndisease population. Therefore, we made maximal efforts to \nobtain unbiased data for subjects with TS and NS that were \nrepresentative of overall TS and NS populations in Japan. Table \n2 summarizes the characteristics considered in the development \nof disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with \nTS and NS. For TS, we first utilized an existing nationwide \ncohort of TS patients before GH treatment in Japan. However, \nthis cohort did not represent the true population of TS due \nto diagnosis bias. To overcome this significant selection bias, \nwe compiled new hospital data in addition to the cohort data \nand analyzed both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. \nThese efforts have made the TS-specific charts closer to the \ntrue TS standards. For NS, there was not an existing cohort with \nanthropometric data. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide \nquestionnaire survey of multidisciplinary specialists, as NS is a \nclinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. As diagnosis \nof NS can be difficult, it was essential to have reliable diagnoses. \nTo do so, we only compiled data for subjects diagnosed by \ncertified specialists and validated the diagnosis using the \nscoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.\n37). Although \nthese efforts may not be perfect, we believe that the collected \nTable 2.

As the population of Japan is generally considered \nethnically homogeneous, we did not need to consider ethnicity \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. Theoretically, \nlocal TS and NS-specific growth charts would be most suitable \nfor individual growth monitoring in different countries. \nHowever, developing these charts can be difficult. It is of note \nthat there are no other disease-specific growth charts in TS and \nNS for Asian populations except for our charts. If our charts \nare used for other Asian populations, physicians should bear in \nmind how growth patterns in their countries differ from those \nin Japanese. For example, if our charts were utilized by Korean \nphysicians, they should know the difference in growth patterns \nbetween the two countries. Fig. 1 shows growth charts of the \nnormal Japanese population\n46) superimposed on the normal \nKorean population\n47). As the figure shows, there is considerable \noverlap except for younger and pubertal ages. Therefore, our TS \nand NS-specific growth charts might be applicable as long as \nphysicians are aware of the different growth patterns between \ntwo countries in the general population.\nConclusions\nDisease-specific growth charts are very useful tools. Theoreti\u00ad\ncally, these charts should be constructed for each ethnic group. \nHowever, gathering unbiased subject measurements is very \nchallenging.

As the growth patterns of affected \nindividuals differ from those of normal populations, it is challenging to detect \nadditional conditions that can influence growth using standard growth charts. \nDisease-specific growth charts are thus very useful tools and can be helpful for \nunderstanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis of congenital diseases. In \naddition, disease-specific growth charts allow doctors to detect deviations from \nthe usual growth patterns for early diagnosis of an additional condition and can \nbe used to evaluate the effects of growth-promoting treatment for patients. When \ndeveloping these charts, factors that can affect the reliability of the charts should \nbe considered. These factors include the definition of the disease with growth \nfailure, selection bias in the measurements used to develop the charts, secular \ntrends of the subjects, the numbers of subjects of varying ages and ethnicities, and \nthe statistical method used to develop the charts. In this review, we summarize the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with Turner \nsyndrome and Noonan syndrome and evaluate the efforts to collect unbiased \nmeasurements of subjects with these diseases. These charts were the only available \ndisease-specific growth charts of Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome for Asian \npopulations and were developed using a Japanese population. Therefore, when \nthese charts are adopted for Asian populations other than Japanese, different \ngrowth patterns should be considered. \nKeywords: Growth charts, Disease-specific growth chart, Turner syndrome, Noonan \nsyndrome, LMS method, Asian population\nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\n1,\nSusumu Yokoya, MD, PhD\n2\n1Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, \nTokyo, \n2Fukushima Global Medical \nScience Center, Fukushima Medical \nUniversity, Fukushima, Japan\nhttps://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.4.240\nAnn Pediatr Endocrinol Metab 2017;22:240-246\n\u00a92017 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism\nReceived: 12 December, 2017\nAccepted: 18 December, 2017\nAddress for correspondence: \nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, 2-11-\n1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-8606, \nJapan\nTel: +81-3-3964-1211\nFax: +81-3-3579-8212\nE-mail: isojimat-tky@umin.ac.jp\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-0011-\n0325\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nISSN: 2287-1012(Print) \nISSN: 2287-1292(Online) \nIntroduction\nGrowth charts are vital tools used worldwide for evaluating the growth of children in clinical \nsettings as well as public health examinations\n1,2). These charts enable physicians to compare the \ngrowth of an individual with that of the general population, assessing whether the individual \nhas growth failure or not. Starting with such assessment, a physician can investigate a specific \ndiagnosis for an individual with growth failure, although the diagnosis is usually determined \nby other findings such as clinical features, hormone levels, karyotyping, or bone radiographs.\nMany congenital diseases are associated with growth failure, and patients with these diseases \nshow characteristic growth patterns. As the growth patterns of affected individuals differ \nfrom those of the normal population, it is challenging to detect additional conditions that \ninfluence their growth using growth charts for the normal population. In clinical settings, it is \nessential for physicians to consider other possible contributory factors besides the established \ndiagnosis. To that end, disease-specific growth charts are very useful and are necessary for \nseveral reasons\n3). First, they are helpful for understanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis \nof a disease. Second, they enable the detection of deviations from typical growth patterns in \n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n241\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\naffected individuals and aid in early diagnosis of additional \nconditions. Finally, they are very useful for evaluating the \neffects of growth-promoting treatment among patients. At \npresent, disease-specific growth charts are available for several \nsyndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, \nWilliams syndrome, Turner syndrome (TS), and Noonan \nsyndrome (NS)\n4-10).\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, we should \nconsider several factors that may affect the reliability of the \ncharts (Table 1). First, we should determine if the disease with \ngrowth failure can be precisely defined. If the pathogenesis \nor etiology of the disease is ambiguous, we cannot admit the \nsignificance of disease-specific growth charts. Second, we should \navoid selection bias in subject measurements whenever possible. \nIt often occurs that subjects recruited for measurements are not \nrepresentative of the overall disease population, as diagnoses \nare usually made after many symptoms manifest. Therefore, it \nis possible that the sample used for measurements is biased by \ndelayed diagnosis of the disease, and if we analyzed only cross-\nsectional data, the developed disease-specific growth charts \nmay show biased and different growth patterns. This will be \ndiscussed later in the example on the development of growth \ncharts in TS. Additional selection bias may derive from the \nspecialties of the physicians seeing the patients, which will be \ndiscussed later in the example of the development of growth \ncharts in NS. Briefly, in clinically heterogeneous disease such \nas NS where many specialists are involved in care, subject \nmeasurements should be obtained from multidisciplinary \nspecialists. In addition, the rearing environment of the subjects \nmay cause selection bias. Third, we should consider secular \ntrends among subjects when gathering data. For rare diseases, \nit can be difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients. \nTherefore, we tend to recruit subjects over many years, which \ncan cause the developed disease-specific growth charts to be \naffected by secular growth trends. Fourth, we should collect \nmeasurements from a sufficient number of patients of all ages \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. If insufficient \nsubjects are available in certain age categories, a bump or a \ndip will be observed in the growth charts, which reflects the \nsampling error that occurs with a small number of subjects. \nFifth, we should consider that ethnicity can influence the \ngrowth of children with a disease. Finally, we should analyze \nprecise anthropometric data using proper statistical methods. \nConsidering all these factors, it seems almost impossible to \ncollect ideal data to establish true disease-specific standards. \nHowever, is it necessary to do so because disease-specific growth \nreferences remain meaningful tools for physicians in various \nclinical settings\n3). In this review, we summarize our experiences \ndeveloping disease-specific growth charts in TS\n8) and NS\n9,10).\nDevelopment of growth charts in TS\nTS is a chromosomal disorder occurring in females that is \ncharacterized by short stature and primary ovarian failure. It is \nthe most common chromosomal disorder in females, and the \nincidence is estimated at 1 in 1,500\u20132,500 live births\n11-13). TS is \ndefined by a karyotype that contains a cell line of monosomy \nlacking at least the distal major part of the short arm of one X \nchromosome. The growth patterns of TS girls are different from \nthose of normal individuals\n11-13). The birth length in TS is smaller \nthan that in normal populations due to mild growth delay in \nutero. After birth, the growth velocity gradually declines. The \nlength/height of girls with TS often remains within the normal \nrange during infancy, but usually falls below the fifth percentile \nof the normal population by the age of 5 years. Growth failure is \nmore evident as girls become mature, and growth spurts are not \nobserved during the expected pubertal period. Untreated adults \nwith TS are reported to be approximately 20 cm shorter than \nnormal female adults\n14).\nTS-specific growth charts are available in many coun\u00ad\ntries\n8,15-23). In Japan, the first TS-specific growth charts were \ndeveloped by Suwa\n20) in 1992. These charts were constructed \nusing data from 704 girls with TS (6,255 measurements) born \nfrom 1955 to 1989 (median unknown), meaning that most of \nthe analyzed subjects were born in 1972 or earlier. As the secular \ntrend of increasing height among Japanese children reached a \nplateau around 1990\n7), the TS-specific growth charts developed \nby Suwa\n20) became inappropriate for the evaluation of girls \nrecently diagnosed with TS. Thus, revisions to the charts were \nnecessary.\nFor the development of revised TS-specific growth charts, we \nutilized a database from the Foundation for Growth Science\n24). \nThis database controls for the use of growth hormone (GH) \nthrough its registration system and contains pretreatment data \nfor TS patients across Japan. After data cleaning and analyzing \npretreatment data for girls with TS born in 1970 or later, cross-\nsectional growth charts were constructed\n7). However, there was \na problem that the growth charts were shifted downward in \nyounger ages, which seemed to be due to selection bias. Girls \nwith TS who registered with the Foundation during infancy \ntended to be smaller than those who registered beyond infancy, \nbecause the degree of height difference between girls with TS \nand the normal population was smaller in infancy. On the other \nhand, girls with TS who registered at older ages might not have \nbeen affected by this selection bias because the height difference \nTable 1.

In brief, taller \nTS patients are often diagnosed only in older ages. To solve \nthis problem, data for relatively tall TS girls during infancy was \nneeded. To address this issue, we utilized semilongitudinal data \nfor girls with TS diagnosed at older ages. As the Foundation \ndatabase only included 3 consecutive years of data prior to GH \ntreatment, we could not obtain enough data from this source. \nTherefore, we collected new longitudinal data from the medical \nrecords of 205 girls with TS who sought treatment at 2 major \nhospitals in Tokyo (the National Center for Child Health and \nDevelopment and Toranomon Hospital) and used these data \nfor the revision of the growth charts. From the 2 datasets, 2,072 \nsubjects (born from 1970 to 2006, median 1985) were available. \nAfter excluding individuals who lacked the typical TS karyotype \n(n=31), those with spontaneous puberty (n=144), unknown \npuberty at the time of height and weight measurement (n=14), \na history of growth-promoting treatment (n=264), measured \nvalues exceeding \u00b15 standard deviation (SD) in the study \npopulation (n=4), and duplicate registration (n=50), 1,565 \nsubjects were retained for analysis. The presence of puberty was \njudged by statements in the application form (for Foundation \ndata) or the attainment of Tanner 2 breast development \n(for hospital data). Of the 5,796 measurements from 1,565 \nsubjects before growth-promoting treatment, an additional \n24 measurements were excluded because they fell outside \nthe range of \u00b15 SD of the population mean. New TS-specific \ngrowth charts were then constructed from the remaining 5,772 \nmeasurements using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nBased on the new TS-specific growth chart, the mean height \nof an adult female with TS is 141.3\u00b15.6 cm, which is comparable \nto data from other Japanese TS samples (e.g., 143.0\u00b14.9 cm, 18 \nTS females without GH treatment)\n26). According to the chart, \nindividuals with TS at the age of 20 years are, on average, -3.30 \nSD below the mean height for the normal population, which \nis similar to data from foreign countries (-2.54 to -4.15 SD)\n14). \nThese findings support the validity of the new TS-specific \ngrowth chart.\nGirls with TS with spontaneous puberty are significantly \ntaller than those without spontaneous puberty at the age of \n\u226512 years, but the difference is no longer significant when \nthey reach their adult height\n22). Thus, 2 types of growth charts \nmay be necessary during the peripubertal period. However, \nwe only produced TS-specific growth charts for girls without \nspontaneous puberty due to the limited number of pubertal \nsubjects. Nevertheless, when we plotted the measurements from \n144 subjects with spontaneous puberty on the new charts, all \nexcept for 5 measurements were distributed within \u00b12 SD. This \nfinding suggests that the new TS-specific growth charts can be \nused for girls with TS with spontaneous puberty.\nThrough these processes, new TS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese girls were constructed\n8). We believe that the new TS-\nspecific charts can be presumed to be representative of growth \nin girls with TS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practices. In \naddition, these charts are the only TS-specific growth charts \nbased on an Asian population.\nDevelopment of growth charts in NS\nNS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome \nwith an estimated incidence of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 \nlive births\n27-29). The cardinal features of NS are distinctive facial \ncharacteristics that change with age, short stature, congenital \nheart disease, and chest deformity\n27,30). Clinical features of NS \ncan vary within a family, but become more subtle in adult life\n31). \nIndividuals with NS are typically treated by a multidisciplinary \nteam of specialists, which includes pediatric geneticists, \npediatric cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists.\nThe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling \npathway is an essential signaling pathway that controls cell \nproliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein-\ntyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene, \nwhich encodes a tyrosine phosphatase protein involved in \nthe Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, was identified as the first \ncausative gene in NS patients\n32). Increasing evidence indicates \nthat germline mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK \nsignaling pathway cause NS and Noonan-related syndrome\n33). \nWhile mutations in such genes have been identified in \napproximately 60%\u201370% of patients with NS\n34,35), the diagnosis \nof NS remains clinical\n27,36). Several scoring systems are currently \navailable for diagnosis, with the scoring system developed by \nvan der Burgt et al.\n37) in 1994 being the most widely used.\nGrowth patterns of children with NS are different from \nthose of the normal population. The mean birth length is \nslightly shorter, but within the normal range. However, a rapid \ndecline in length/height SD score (SDS) relative to the normal \npopulation develops during the first year of life. Thereafter, \nmean length/height lies approximately on the -2.5 SD line for \nthe normal population until age 12 years in boys and 10.5 years \nin girls. Afterwards, further decline becomes obvious due to \ndelayed puberty, and then the height SDS relative to the normal \npopulation tends to recover.\nNS-specific growth curves are currently available for 4 regions: \nBrazil, Europe, North America, and Japan\n9,10,38-40). Undoubtedly, \nNS-specific charts should be developed with data collected by \nmultidisciplinary specialists. Therefore, when we constructed \nNS-specific growth charts\n9,10), we conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of pediatric geneticists, pediatric cardiologists, and \npediatric endocrinologists responsible for Japanese NS patients. \nWe collaborated with three academic societies (i.e., The Japan \nSociety of Pediatric Genetics, The Japanese Society of Pediatric \nCardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and The Japanese Society for \nPediatric Endocrinology) and gathered data for NS patients \ndiagnosed by specialists from these societies at 31 hospitals \nnationwide. Due to secular trends in height, we recruited \npatients born in 1970 or later\n7). Questionnaires that included \nauxological measurements together with a minimal set of \nclinical and genetic data were sent to these hospitals. Height and \nweight measurements were gathered in a mixed longitudinal \nand cross-sectional manner. The minimal interval between 2 \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n243\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\nmeasurements was 1 month when the subjects were measured \nbefore 1 year of age or 3 months when measured after 1 year of \nage.\nTwenty of the 31 hospitals responded to our questionnaire, \nresulting in data for 356 clinically diagnosed NS patients. A total \nof 48 subjects were excluded because of missing auxological \ndata (n=26), presence of complications that might have affected \ngrowth (n=5), or extreme longitudinal growth aberrations \u00b13 \nSD from the mean (n=17). The remaining 308 subjects (159 \nboys, 149 girls) were analyzed. To develop the growth charts, \n3,249 measurements (boys, 1,674; girls, 1,575) were included \nafter exclusion of 23 measurements from three outliers. Height \nSDSs were not significantly different between individuals with \nand without genetic analysis (difference, 0.076; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.020 to 0.17; P=0.12). NS-specific growth charts \nwere constructed using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nSubjects were diagnosed with NS by certified specialists, \nand thus, diagnoses were very reliable. Moreover, diagnosis \nwas further validated by the scoring system developed by van \nder Burgt et al.\n37). All measurements were properly selected \nby excluding individuals with previous growth-promoting \ntreatment, complications that may affect growth, and extreme \nlongitudinal growth aberrations. Based on the NS-specific \ngrowth charts, adult height is 157.3\u00b17.4 cm for males (-2.3\u00b11.3 \nSDS) and 146.8\u00b16.9 cm for females (-2.1\u00b11.3 SDS). These adult \nheight SDSs for the normal population are comparable to values \nreported in other countries (male, -2.5 to -1.4; female, -2.2 to \n-1.8)\n38-42).\nThrough these processes, NS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese individuals were constructed\n9,10). We believe that \nthese charts can be presumed to be representative of growth in \nindividuals with NS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practice. \nMoreover, these are the only NS-specific growth charts based on \nmeasurements from an Asian population.\nStatistical method used for developing \ngrowth charts\nThe lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method\n43) was used for the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese \nindividuals with TS and NS. The LMS method is a standard \nmethod for establishing growth charts\n44) and is effective at \nconstructing reference charts that show the distribution of \na measurement as it changes by covariates such as age and \ntime. The LMS method includes smoothing with a spline \nfunction after normalizing age-specific data using a power \ntransformation. In this method, the degree of skewness (L), \nmedian (M), and coefficient of variation (S) are estimated by \nage, and SD scores (Z-scores) of each index can be calculated \nfrom the L, M, and S values. This method also allows the \ncalculation of percentiles, as SD scores can be converted to \npercentiles in a normal distribution. The LMS method is usually \nused for establishing growth charts based on cross-sectional \ndata. However, it can also be used for establishing growth \ncharts based on longitudinal data when the measurements are \nwidely scattered and there are no subjects with a nonnegligible \ninfluence on the charts\n9,45). In the data used for development of \ndisease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with TS \nand NS, numerous measurements were scattered across the age \nrange and all subjects had a significant influence on the growth \ncharts.\nDiscussion\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, it is essential \nto collect anthropometric measurements that reflect the true \ndisease population. Therefore, we made maximal efforts to \nobtain unbiased data for subjects with TS and NS that were \nrepresentative of overall TS and NS populations in Japan. Table \n2 summarizes the characteristics considered in the development \nof disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with \nTS and NS. For TS, we first utilized an existing nationwide \ncohort of TS patients before GH treatment in Japan. However, \nthis cohort did not represent the true population of TS due \nto diagnosis bias. To overcome this significant selection bias, \nwe compiled new hospital data in addition to the cohort data \nand analyzed both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. \nThese efforts have made the TS-specific charts closer to the \ntrue TS standards. For NS, there was not an existing cohort with \nanthropometric data. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide \nquestionnaire survey of multidisciplinary specialists, as NS is a \nclinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. As diagnosis \nof NS can be difficult, it was essential to have reliable diagnoses. \nTo do so, we only compiled data for subjects diagnosed by \ncertified specialists and validated the diagnosis using the \nscoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.\n37). Although \nthese efforts may not be perfect, we believe that the collected \nTable 2.

As the population of Japan is generally considered \nethnically homogeneous, we did not need to consider ethnicity \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. Theoretically, \nlocal TS and NS-specific growth charts would be most suitable \nfor individual growth monitoring in different countries. \nHowever, developing these charts can be difficult. It is of note \nthat there are no other disease-specific growth charts in TS and \nNS for Asian populations except for our charts. If our charts \nare used for other Asian populations, physicians should bear in \nmind how growth patterns in their countries differ from those \nin Japanese. For example, if our charts were utilized by Korean \nphysicians, they should know the difference in growth patterns \nbetween the two countries. Fig. 1 shows growth charts of the \nnormal Japanese population\n46) superimposed on the normal \nKorean population\n47). As the figure shows, there is considerable \noverlap except for younger and pubertal ages. Therefore, our TS \nand NS-specific growth charts might be applicable as long as \nphysicians are aware of the different growth patterns between \ntwo countries in the general population.\nConclusions\nDisease-specific growth charts are very useful tools. Theoreti\u00ad\ncally, these charts should be constructed for each ethnic group. \nHowever, gathering unbiased subject measurements is very \nchallenging. Here, we reviewed the development of disease-\nspecific charts for Japanese individuals with TS and NS. When \nusing disease-specific charts developed using data from other \nethnic groups, physicians should consider the underlying \ndifferences in normal growth patterns between ethnic groups.\nConflict of interest\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was \nreported.\nReferences \n1.\t\nHermanussen M.

As the growth patterns of affected \nindividuals differ from those of normal populations, it is challenging to detect \nadditional conditions that can influence growth using standard growth charts. \nDisease-specific growth charts are thus very useful tools and can be helpful for \nunderstanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis of congenital diseases. In \naddition, disease-specific growth charts allow doctors to detect deviations from \nthe usual growth patterns for early diagnosis of an additional condition and can \nbe used to evaluate the effects of growth-promoting treatment for patients. When \ndeveloping these charts, factors that can affect the reliability of the charts should \nbe considered. These factors include the definition of the disease with growth \nfailure, selection bias in the measurements used to develop the charts, secular \ntrends of the subjects, the numbers of subjects of varying ages and ethnicities, and \nthe statistical method used to develop the charts. In this review, we summarize the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with Turner \nsyndrome and Noonan syndrome and evaluate the efforts to collect unbiased \nmeasurements of subjects with these diseases. These charts were the only available \ndisease-specific growth charts of Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome for Asian \npopulations and were developed using a Japanese population. Therefore, when \nthese charts are adopted for Asian populations other than Japanese, different \ngrowth patterns should be considered. \nKeywords: Growth charts, Disease-specific growth chart, Turner syndrome, Noonan \nsyndrome, LMS method, Asian population\nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\n1,\nSusumu Yokoya, MD, PhD\n2\n1Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, \nTokyo, \n2Fukushima Global Medical \nScience Center, Fukushima Medical \nUniversity, Fukushima, Japan\nhttps://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.4.240\nAnn Pediatr Endocrinol Metab 2017;22:240-246\n\u00a92017 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism\nReceived: 12 December, 2017\nAccepted: 18 December, 2017\nAddress for correspondence: \nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, 2-11-\n1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-8606, \nJapan\nTel: +81-3-3964-1211\nFax: +81-3-3579-8212\nE-mail: isojimat-tky@umin.ac.jp\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-0011-\n0325\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nISSN: 2287-1012(Print) \nISSN: 2287-1292(Online) \nIntroduction\nGrowth charts are vital tools used worldwide for evaluating the growth of children in clinical \nsettings as well as public health examinations\n1,2). These charts enable physicians to compare the \ngrowth of an individual with that of the general population, assessing whether the individual \nhas growth failure or not. Starting with such assessment, a physician can investigate a specific \ndiagnosis for an individual with growth failure, although the diagnosis is usually determined \nby other findings such as clinical features, hormone levels, karyotyping, or bone radiographs.\nMany congenital diseases are associated with growth failure, and patients with these diseases \nshow characteristic growth patterns. As the growth patterns of affected individuals differ \nfrom those of the normal population, it is challenging to detect additional conditions that \ninfluence their growth using growth charts for the normal population. In clinical settings, it is \nessential for physicians to consider other possible contributory factors besides the established \ndiagnosis. To that end, disease-specific growth charts are very useful and are necessary for \nseveral reasons\n3). First, they are helpful for understanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis \nof a disease. Second, they enable the detection of deviations from typical growth patterns in \n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n241\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\naffected individuals and aid in early diagnosis of additional \nconditions. Finally, they are very useful for evaluating the \neffects of growth-promoting treatment among patients. At \npresent, disease-specific growth charts are available for several \nsyndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, \nWilliams syndrome, Turner syndrome (TS), and Noonan \nsyndrome (NS)\n4-10).\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, we should \nconsider several factors that may affect the reliability of the \ncharts (Table 1). First, we should determine if the disease with \ngrowth failure can be precisely defined. If the pathogenesis \nor etiology of the disease is ambiguous, we cannot admit the \nsignificance of disease-specific growth charts. Second, we should \navoid selection bias in subject measurements whenever possible. \nIt often occurs that subjects recruited for measurements are not \nrepresentative of the overall disease population, as diagnoses \nare usually made after many symptoms manifest. Therefore, it \nis possible that the sample used for measurements is biased by \ndelayed diagnosis of the disease, and if we analyzed only cross-\nsectional data, the developed disease-specific growth charts \nmay show biased and different growth patterns. This will be \ndiscussed later in the example on the development of growth \ncharts in TS. Additional selection bias may derive from the \nspecialties of the physicians seeing the patients, which will be \ndiscussed later in the example of the development of growth \ncharts in NS. Briefly, in clinically heterogeneous disease such \nas NS where many specialists are involved in care, subject \nmeasurements should be obtained from multidisciplinary \nspecialists. In addition, the rearing environment of the subjects \nmay cause selection bias. Third, we should consider secular \ntrends among subjects when gathering data. For rare diseases, \nit can be difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients. \nTherefore, we tend to recruit subjects over many years, which \ncan cause the developed disease-specific growth charts to be \naffected by secular growth trends. Fourth, we should collect \nmeasurements from a sufficient number of patients of all ages \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. If insufficient \nsubjects are available in certain age categories, a bump or a \ndip will be observed in the growth charts, which reflects the \nsampling error that occurs with a small number of subjects. \nFifth, we should consider that ethnicity can influence the \ngrowth of children with a disease. Finally, we should analyze \nprecise anthropometric data using proper statistical methods. \nConsidering all these factors, it seems almost impossible to \ncollect ideal data to establish true disease-specific standards. \nHowever, is it necessary to do so because disease-specific growth \nreferences remain meaningful tools for physicians in various \nclinical settings\n3). In this review, we summarize our experiences \ndeveloping disease-specific growth charts in TS\n8) and NS\n9,10).\nDevelopment of growth charts in TS\nTS is a chromosomal disorder occurring in females that is \ncharacterized by short stature and primary ovarian failure. It is \nthe most common chromosomal disorder in females, and the \nincidence is estimated at 1 in 1,500\u20132,500 live births\n11-13). TS is \ndefined by a karyotype that contains a cell line of monosomy \nlacking at least the distal major part of the short arm of one X \nchromosome. The growth patterns of TS girls are different from \nthose of normal individuals\n11-13). The birth length in TS is smaller \nthan that in normal populations due to mild growth delay in \nutero. After birth, the growth velocity gradually declines. The \nlength/height of girls with TS often remains within the normal \nrange during infancy, but usually falls below the fifth percentile \nof the normal population by the age of 5 years. Growth failure is \nmore evident as girls become mature, and growth spurts are not \nobserved during the expected pubertal period. Untreated adults \nwith TS are reported to be approximately 20 cm shorter than \nnormal female adults\n14).\nTS-specific growth charts are available in many coun\u00ad\ntries\n8,15-23). In Japan, the first TS-specific growth charts were \ndeveloped by Suwa\n20) in 1992. These charts were constructed \nusing data from 704 girls with TS (6,255 measurements) born \nfrom 1955 to 1989 (median unknown), meaning that most of \nthe analyzed subjects were born in 1972 or earlier. As the secular \ntrend of increasing height among Japanese children reached a \nplateau around 1990\n7), the TS-specific growth charts developed \nby Suwa\n20) became inappropriate for the evaluation of girls \nrecently diagnosed with TS. Thus, revisions to the charts were \nnecessary.\nFor the development of revised TS-specific growth charts, we \nutilized a database from the Foundation for Growth Science\n24). \nThis database controls for the use of growth hormone (GH) \nthrough its registration system and contains pretreatment data \nfor TS patients across Japan. After data cleaning and analyzing \npretreatment data for girls with TS born in 1970 or later, cross-\nsectional growth charts were constructed\n7). However, there was \na problem that the growth charts were shifted downward in \nyounger ages, which seemed to be due to selection bias. Girls \nwith TS who registered with the Foundation during infancy \ntended to be smaller than those who registered beyond infancy, \nbecause the degree of height difference between girls with TS \nand the normal population was smaller in infancy. On the other \nhand, girls with TS who registered at older ages might not have \nbeen affected by this selection bias because the height difference \nTable 1.

In brief, taller \nTS patients are often diagnosed only in older ages. To solve \nthis problem, data for relatively tall TS girls during infancy was \nneeded. To address this issue, we utilized semilongitudinal data \nfor girls with TS diagnosed at older ages. As the Foundation \ndatabase only included 3 consecutive years of data prior to GH \ntreatment, we could not obtain enough data from this source. \nTherefore, we collected new longitudinal data from the medical \nrecords of 205 girls with TS who sought treatment at 2 major \nhospitals in Tokyo (the National Center for Child Health and \nDevelopment and Toranomon Hospital) and used these data \nfor the revision of the growth charts. From the 2 datasets, 2,072 \nsubjects (born from 1970 to 2006, median 1985) were available. \nAfter excluding individuals who lacked the typical TS karyotype \n(n=31), those with spontaneous puberty (n=144), unknown \npuberty at the time of height and weight measurement (n=14), \na history of growth-promoting treatment (n=264), measured \nvalues exceeding \u00b15 standard deviation (SD) in the study \npopulation (n=4), and duplicate registration (n=50), 1,565 \nsubjects were retained for analysis. The presence of puberty was \njudged by statements in the application form (for Foundation \ndata) or the attainment of Tanner 2 breast development \n(for hospital data). Of the 5,796 measurements from 1,565 \nsubjects before growth-promoting treatment, an additional \n24 measurements were excluded because they fell outside \nthe range of \u00b15 SD of the population mean. New TS-specific \ngrowth charts were then constructed from the remaining 5,772 \nmeasurements using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nBased on the new TS-specific growth chart, the mean height \nof an adult female with TS is 141.3\u00b15.6 cm, which is comparable \nto data from other Japanese TS samples (e.g., 143.0\u00b14.9 cm, 18 \nTS females without GH treatment)\n26). According to the chart, \nindividuals with TS at the age of 20 years are, on average, -3.30 \nSD below the mean height for the normal population, which \nis similar to data from foreign countries (-2.54 to -4.15 SD)\n14). \nThese findings support the validity of the new TS-specific \ngrowth chart.\nGirls with TS with spontaneous puberty are significantly \ntaller than those without spontaneous puberty at the age of \n\u226512 years, but the difference is no longer significant when \nthey reach their adult height\n22). Thus, 2 types of growth charts \nmay be necessary during the peripubertal period. However, \nwe only produced TS-specific growth charts for girls without \nspontaneous puberty due to the limited number of pubertal \nsubjects. Nevertheless, when we plotted the measurements from \n144 subjects with spontaneous puberty on the new charts, all \nexcept for 5 measurements were distributed within \u00b12 SD. This \nfinding suggests that the new TS-specific growth charts can be \nused for girls with TS with spontaneous puberty.\nThrough these processes, new TS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese girls were constructed\n8). We believe that the new TS-\nspecific charts can be presumed to be representative of growth \nin girls with TS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practices. In \naddition, these charts are the only TS-specific growth charts \nbased on an Asian population.\nDevelopment of growth charts in NS\nNS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome \nwith an estimated incidence of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 \nlive births\n27-29). The cardinal features of NS are distinctive facial \ncharacteristics that change with age, short stature, congenital \nheart disease, and chest deformity\n27,30). Clinical features of NS \ncan vary within a family, but become more subtle in adult life\n31). \nIndividuals with NS are typically treated by a multidisciplinary \nteam of specialists, which includes pediatric geneticists, \npediatric cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists.\nThe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling \npathway is an essential signaling pathway that controls cell \nproliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein-\ntyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene, \nwhich encodes a tyrosine phosphatase protein involved in \nthe Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, was identified as the first \ncausative gene in NS patients\n32). Increasing evidence indicates \nthat germline mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK \nsignaling pathway cause NS and Noonan-related syndrome\n33). \nWhile mutations in such genes have been identified in \napproximately 60%\u201370% of patients with NS\n34,35), the diagnosis \nof NS remains clinical\n27,36). Several scoring systems are currently \navailable for diagnosis, with the scoring system developed by \nvan der Burgt et al.\n37) in 1994 being the most widely used.\nGrowth patterns of children with NS are different from \nthose of the normal population. The mean birth length is \nslightly shorter, but within the normal range. However, a rapid \ndecline in length/height SD score (SDS) relative to the normal \npopulation develops during the first year of life. Thereafter, \nmean length/height lies approximately on the -2.5 SD line for \nthe normal population until age 12 years in boys and 10.5 years \nin girls. Afterwards, further decline becomes obvious due to \ndelayed puberty, and then the height SDS relative to the normal \npopulation tends to recover.\nNS-specific growth curves are currently available for 4 regions: \nBrazil, Europe, North America, and Japan\n9,10,38-40). Undoubtedly, \nNS-specific charts should be developed with data collected by \nmultidisciplinary specialists. Therefore, when we constructed \nNS-specific growth charts\n9,10), we conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of pediatric geneticists, pediatric cardiologists, and \npediatric endocrinologists responsible for Japanese NS patients. \nWe collaborated with three academic societies (i.e., The Japan \nSociety of Pediatric Genetics, The Japanese Society of Pediatric \nCardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and The Japanese Society for \nPediatric Endocrinology) and gathered data for NS patients \ndiagnosed by specialists from these societies at 31 hospitals \nnationwide. Due to secular trends in height, we recruited \npatients born in 1970 or later\n7). Questionnaires that included \nauxological measurements together with a minimal set of \nclinical and genetic data were sent to these hospitals. Height and \nweight measurements were gathered in a mixed longitudinal \nand cross-sectional manner. The minimal interval between 2 \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n243\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\nmeasurements was 1 month when the subjects were measured \nbefore 1 year of age or 3 months when measured after 1 year of \nage.\nTwenty of the 31 hospitals responded to our questionnaire, \nresulting in data for 356 clinically diagnosed NS patients. A total \nof 48 subjects were excluded because of missing auxological \ndata (n=26), presence of complications that might have affected \ngrowth (n=5), or extreme longitudinal growth aberrations \u00b13 \nSD from the mean (n=17). The remaining 308 subjects (159 \nboys, 149 girls) were analyzed. To develop the growth charts, \n3,249 measurements (boys, 1,674; girls, 1,575) were included \nafter exclusion of 23 measurements from three outliers. Height \nSDSs were not significantly different between individuals with \nand without genetic analysis (difference, 0.076; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.020 to 0.17; P=0.12). NS-specific growth charts \nwere constructed using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nSubjects were diagnosed with NS by certified specialists, \nand thus, diagnoses were very reliable. Moreover, diagnosis \nwas further validated by the scoring system developed by van \nder Burgt et al.\n37). All measurements were properly selected \nby excluding individuals with previous growth-promoting \ntreatment, complications that may affect growth, and extreme \nlongitudinal growth aberrations. Based on the NS-specific \ngrowth charts, adult height is 157.3\u00b17.4 cm for males (-2.3\u00b11.3 \nSDS) and 146.8\u00b16.9 cm for females (-2.1\u00b11.3 SDS). These adult \nheight SDSs for the normal population are comparable to values \nreported in other countries (male, -2.5 to -1.4; female, -2.2 to \n-1.8)\n38-42).\nThrough these processes, NS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese individuals were constructed\n9,10). We believe that \nthese charts can be presumed to be representative of growth in \nindividuals with NS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practice. \nMoreover, these are the only NS-specific growth charts based on \nmeasurements from an Asian population.\nStatistical method used for developing \ngrowth charts\nThe lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method\n43) was used for the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese \nindividuals with TS and NS. The LMS method is a standard \nmethod for establishing growth charts\n44) and is effective at \nconstructing reference charts that show the distribution of \na measurement as it changes by covariates such as age and \ntime. The LMS method includes smoothing with a spline \nfunction after normalizing age-specific data using a power \ntransformation. In this method, the degree of skewness (L), \nmedian (M), and coefficient of variation (S) are estimated by \nage, and SD scores (Z-scores) of each index can be calculated \nfrom the L, M, and S values. This method also allows the \ncalculation of percentiles, as SD scores can be converted to \npercentiles in a normal distribution. The LMS method is usually \nused for establishing growth charts based on cross-sectional \ndata. However, it can also be used for establishing growth \ncharts based on longitudinal data when the measurements are \nwidely scattered and there are no subjects with a nonnegligible \ninfluence on the charts\n9,45). In the data used for development of \ndisease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with TS \nand NS, numerous measurements were scattered across the age \nrange and all subjects had a significant influence on the growth \ncharts.\nDiscussion\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, it is essential \nto collect anthropometric measurements that reflect the true \ndisease population. Therefore, we made maximal efforts to \nobtain unbiased data for subjects with TS and NS that were \nrepresentative of overall TS and NS populations in Japan. Table \n2 summarizes the characteristics considered in the development \nof disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with \nTS and NS. For TS, we first utilized an existing nationwide \ncohort of TS patients before GH treatment in Japan. However, \nthis cohort did not represent the true population of TS due \nto diagnosis bias. To overcome this significant selection bias, \nwe compiled new hospital data in addition to the cohort data \nand analyzed both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. \nThese efforts have made the TS-specific charts closer to the \ntrue TS standards. For NS, there was not an existing cohort with \nanthropometric data. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide \nquestionnaire survey of multidisciplinary specialists, as NS is a \nclinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. As diagnosis \nof NS can be difficult, it was essential to have reliable diagnoses. \nTo do so, we only compiled data for subjects diagnosed by \ncertified specialists and validated the diagnosis using the \nscoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.\n37). Although \nthese efforts may not be perfect, we believe that the collected \nTable 2.

As the population of Japan is generally considered \nethnically homogeneous, we did not need to consider ethnicity \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. Theoretically, \nlocal TS and NS-specific growth charts would be most suitable \nfor individual growth monitoring in different countries. \nHowever, developing these charts can be difficult. It is of note \nthat there are no other disease-specific growth charts in TS and \nNS for Asian populations except for our charts. If our charts \nare used for other Asian populations, physicians should bear in \nmind how growth patterns in their countries differ from those \nin Japanese. For example, if our charts were utilized by Korean \nphysicians, they should know the difference in growth patterns \nbetween the two countries. Fig. 1 shows growth charts of the \nnormal Japanese population\n46) superimposed on the normal \nKorean population\n47). As the figure shows, there is considerable \noverlap except for younger and pubertal ages. Therefore, our TS \nand NS-specific growth charts might be applicable as long as \nphysicians are aware of the different growth patterns between \ntwo countries in the general population.\nConclusions\nDisease-specific growth charts are very useful tools. Theoreti\u00ad\ncally, these charts should be constructed for each ethnic group. \nHowever, gathering unbiased subject measurements is very \nchallenging. Here, we reviewed the development of disease-\nspecific charts for Japanese individuals with TS and NS. When \nusing disease-specific charts developed using data from other \nethnic groups, physicians should consider the underlying \ndifferences in normal growth patterns between ethnic groups.\nConflict of interest\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was \nreported.\nReferences \n1.\t\nHermanussen M.

To introduce a multidisciplinary approach for the management of COVID-19-infected \npatients and to report the first operated patient in the Corona unit.\nMethods\u2002 A detailed presentation of the hospital plan for a separate Corona unit with its intensive care unit and operating \nrooms. Description of the management of the first spine surgery case treated in this unit.\nResults\u2002 The Corona unit showed a practical approach for the management of an emergency cervical spine fracture-dislocation \nwith acute paralysis. The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the \ninternal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room. Education of the medical staff and organiza-\ntion of the operating theatre facilitated the management of the patient without an increased risk of spreading the infection.\nConclusions\u2002 The current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary organization of the medical and surgical care of \nthe patients. It is possible to manage an infected or a potentially infected patient surgically, but a multidisciplinary plan is \nnecessary to protect other patients and the medical staff.\nKeywords\u2002 COVID-19\u00a0\u00b7 Emergency\u00a0\u00b7 Cervical fracture\u00a0\u00b7 Corona ward\u00a0\u00b7 Surgical planning\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nIn late 2019, a series of severe acute respiratory syndrome \n(SARS) was reported in China. The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms. Protective masks (FFP3 filtering facepiece particle \nFig.\u202f2\u2002 \u2009A 92-year-old female patient presenting with fracture-dislocation C6-7. Sagittal CT a, facet joint dislocation on the right side b, facet \njoint dislocation on the left side c, MRI examination d and postoperative X-ray showing reduction and fixation e\u200a\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n472\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\n3), head covers and eye goggles are adequately stocked in the \noperating rooms. The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation. Surgical team (a), anaesthesia team (b) and the operating room equipment (c)\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n473\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\nthe neurological status was recorded (ASIA B). On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions. Tian et\u00a0al. [17] \nrecently published their experience with telerobotic spinal \nsurgery based on 5G technology. They performed remote \nsurgery in 12 cases and concluded that this technology could \nbuild a connection between surgeons and patients located in \nisolated or rural areas with a lack of medical resources. We \ndo not have experience with this technology; however, this \nmight be an attractive option in such pandemic situations \nprovided the necessary infrastructures are available.\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n474\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nElective spine operations, is\u00a0it the\u00a0right time?\nIn the last few weeks, the number of new cases is signifi-\ncantly reduced. We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.

As the growth patterns of affected \nindividuals differ from those of normal populations, it is challenging to detect \nadditional conditions that can influence growth using standard growth charts. \nDisease-specific growth charts are thus very useful tools and can be helpful for \nunderstanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis of congenital diseases. In \naddition, disease-specific growth charts allow doctors to detect deviations from \nthe usual growth patterns for early diagnosis of an additional condition and can \nbe used to evaluate the effects of growth-promoting treatment for patients. When \ndeveloping these charts, factors that can affect the reliability of the charts should \nbe considered. These factors include the definition of the disease with growth \nfailure, selection bias in the measurements used to develop the charts, secular \ntrends of the subjects, the numbers of subjects of varying ages and ethnicities, and \nthe statistical method used to develop the charts. In this review, we summarize the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with Turner \nsyndrome and Noonan syndrome and evaluate the efforts to collect unbiased \nmeasurements of subjects with these diseases. These charts were the only available \ndisease-specific growth charts of Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome for Asian \npopulations and were developed using a Japanese population. Therefore, when \nthese charts are adopted for Asian populations other than Japanese, different \ngrowth patterns should be considered. \nKeywords: Growth charts, Disease-specific growth chart, Turner syndrome, Noonan \nsyndrome, LMS method, Asian population\nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\n1,\nSusumu Yokoya, MD, PhD\n2\n1Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, \nTokyo, \n2Fukushima Global Medical \nScience Center, Fukushima Medical \nUniversity, Fukushima, Japan\nhttps://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.4.240\nAnn Pediatr Endocrinol Metab 2017;22:240-246\n\u00a92017 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism\nReceived: 12 December, 2017\nAccepted: 18 December, 2017\nAddress for correspondence: \nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, 2-11-\n1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-8606, \nJapan\nTel: +81-3-3964-1211\nFax: +81-3-3579-8212\nE-mail: isojimat-tky@umin.ac.jp\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-0011-\n0325\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nISSN: 2287-1012(Print) \nISSN: 2287-1292(Online) \nIntroduction\nGrowth charts are vital tools used worldwide for evaluating the growth of children in clinical \nsettings as well as public health examinations\n1,2). These charts enable physicians to compare the \ngrowth of an individual with that of the general population, assessing whether the individual \nhas growth failure or not. Starting with such assessment, a physician can investigate a specific \ndiagnosis for an individual with growth failure, although the diagnosis is usually determined \nby other findings such as clinical features, hormone levels, karyotyping, or bone radiographs.\nMany congenital diseases are associated with growth failure, and patients with these diseases \nshow characteristic growth patterns. As the growth patterns of affected individuals differ \nfrom those of the normal population, it is challenging to detect additional conditions that \ninfluence their growth using growth charts for the normal population. In clinical settings, it is \nessential for physicians to consider other possible contributory factors besides the established \ndiagnosis. To that end, disease-specific growth charts are very useful and are necessary for \nseveral reasons\n3). First, they are helpful for understanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis \nof a disease. Second, they enable the detection of deviations from typical growth patterns in \n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n241\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\naffected individuals and aid in early diagnosis of additional \nconditions. Finally, they are very useful for evaluating the \neffects of growth-promoting treatment among patients. At \npresent, disease-specific growth charts are available for several \nsyndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, \nWilliams syndrome, Turner syndrome (TS), and Noonan \nsyndrome (NS)\n4-10).\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, we should \nconsider several factors that may affect the reliability of the \ncharts (Table 1). First, we should determine if the disease with \ngrowth failure can be precisely defined. If the pathogenesis \nor etiology of the disease is ambiguous, we cannot admit the \nsignificance of disease-specific growth charts. Second, we should \navoid selection bias in subject measurements whenever possible. \nIt often occurs that subjects recruited for measurements are not \nrepresentative of the overall disease population, as diagnoses \nare usually made after many symptoms manifest. Therefore, it \nis possible that the sample used for measurements is biased by \ndelayed diagnosis of the disease, and if we analyzed only cross-\nsectional data, the developed disease-specific growth charts \nmay show biased and different growth patterns. This will be \ndiscussed later in the example on the development of growth \ncharts in TS. Additional selection bias may derive from the \nspecialties of the physicians seeing the patients, which will be \ndiscussed later in the example of the development of growth \ncharts in NS. Briefly, in clinically heterogeneous disease such \nas NS where many specialists are involved in care, subject \nmeasurements should be obtained from multidisciplinary \nspecialists. In addition, the rearing environment of the subjects \nmay cause selection bias. Third, we should consider secular \ntrends among subjects when gathering data. For rare diseases, \nit can be difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients. \nTherefore, we tend to recruit subjects over many years, which \ncan cause the developed disease-specific growth charts to be \naffected by secular growth trends. Fourth, we should collect \nmeasurements from a sufficient number of patients of all ages \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. If insufficient \nsubjects are available in certain age categories, a bump or a \ndip will be observed in the growth charts, which reflects the \nsampling error that occurs with a small number of subjects. \nFifth, we should consider that ethnicity can influence the \ngrowth of children with a disease. Finally, we should analyze \nprecise anthropometric data using proper statistical methods. \nConsidering all these factors, it seems almost impossible to \ncollect ideal data to establish true disease-specific standards. \nHowever, is it necessary to do so because disease-specific growth \nreferences remain meaningful tools for physicians in various \nclinical settings\n3). In this review, we summarize our experiences \ndeveloping disease-specific growth charts in TS\n8) and NS\n9,10).\nDevelopment of growth charts in TS\nTS is a chromosomal disorder occurring in females that is \ncharacterized by short stature and primary ovarian failure. It is \nthe most common chromosomal disorder in females, and the \nincidence is estimated at 1 in 1,500\u20132,500 live births\n11-13). TS is \ndefined by a karyotype that contains a cell line of monosomy \nlacking at least the distal major part of the short arm of one X \nchromosome. The growth patterns of TS girls are different from \nthose of normal individuals\n11-13). The birth length in TS is smaller \nthan that in normal populations due to mild growth delay in \nutero. After birth, the growth velocity gradually declines. The \nlength/height of girls with TS often remains within the normal \nrange during infancy, but usually falls below the fifth percentile \nof the normal population by the age of 5 years. Growth failure is \nmore evident as girls become mature, and growth spurts are not \nobserved during the expected pubertal period. Untreated adults \nwith TS are reported to be approximately 20 cm shorter than \nnormal female adults\n14).\nTS-specific growth charts are available in many coun\u00ad\ntries\n8,15-23). In Japan, the first TS-specific growth charts were \ndeveloped by Suwa\n20) in 1992. These charts were constructed \nusing data from 704 girls with TS (6,255 measurements) born \nfrom 1955 to 1989 (median unknown), meaning that most of \nthe analyzed subjects were born in 1972 or earlier. As the secular \ntrend of increasing height among Japanese children reached a \nplateau around 1990\n7), the TS-specific growth charts developed \nby Suwa\n20) became inappropriate for the evaluation of girls \nrecently diagnosed with TS. Thus, revisions to the charts were \nnecessary.\nFor the development of revised TS-specific growth charts, we \nutilized a database from the Foundation for Growth Science\n24). \nThis database controls for the use of growth hormone (GH) \nthrough its registration system and contains pretreatment data \nfor TS patients across Japan. After data cleaning and analyzing \npretreatment data for girls with TS born in 1970 or later, cross-\nsectional growth charts were constructed\n7). However, there was \na problem that the growth charts were shifted downward in \nyounger ages, which seemed to be due to selection bias. Girls \nwith TS who registered with the Foundation during infancy \ntended to be smaller than those who registered beyond infancy, \nbecause the degree of height difference between girls with TS \nand the normal population was smaller in infancy. On the other \nhand, girls with TS who registered at older ages might not have \nbeen affected by this selection bias because the height difference \nTable 1.

In brief, taller \nTS patients are often diagnosed only in older ages. To solve \nthis problem, data for relatively tall TS girls during infancy was \nneeded. To address this issue, we utilized semilongitudinal data \nfor girls with TS diagnosed at older ages. As the Foundation \ndatabase only included 3 consecutive years of data prior to GH \ntreatment, we could not obtain enough data from this source. \nTherefore, we collected new longitudinal data from the medical \nrecords of 205 girls with TS who sought treatment at 2 major \nhospitals in Tokyo (the National Center for Child Health and \nDevelopment and Toranomon Hospital) and used these data \nfor the revision of the growth charts. From the 2 datasets, 2,072 \nsubjects (born from 1970 to 2006, median 1985) were available. \nAfter excluding individuals who lacked the typical TS karyotype \n(n=31), those with spontaneous puberty (n=144), unknown \npuberty at the time of height and weight measurement (n=14), \na history of growth-promoting treatment (n=264), measured \nvalues exceeding \u00b15 standard deviation (SD) in the study \npopulation (n=4), and duplicate registration (n=50), 1,565 \nsubjects were retained for analysis. The presence of puberty was \njudged by statements in the application form (for Foundation \ndata) or the attainment of Tanner 2 breast development \n(for hospital data). Of the 5,796 measurements from 1,565 \nsubjects before growth-promoting treatment, an additional \n24 measurements were excluded because they fell outside \nthe range of \u00b15 SD of the population mean. New TS-specific \ngrowth charts were then constructed from the remaining 5,772 \nmeasurements using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nBased on the new TS-specific growth chart, the mean height \nof an adult female with TS is 141.3\u00b15.6 cm, which is comparable \nto data from other Japanese TS samples (e.g., 143.0\u00b14.9 cm, 18 \nTS females without GH treatment)\n26). According to the chart, \nindividuals with TS at the age of 20 years are, on average, -3.30 \nSD below the mean height for the normal population, which \nis similar to data from foreign countries (-2.54 to -4.15 SD)\n14). \nThese findings support the validity of the new TS-specific \ngrowth chart.\nGirls with TS with spontaneous puberty are significantly \ntaller than those without spontaneous puberty at the age of \n\u226512 years, but the difference is no longer significant when \nthey reach their adult height\n22). Thus, 2 types of growth charts \nmay be necessary during the peripubertal period. However, \nwe only produced TS-specific growth charts for girls without \nspontaneous puberty due to the limited number of pubertal \nsubjects. Nevertheless, when we plotted the measurements from \n144 subjects with spontaneous puberty on the new charts, all \nexcept for 5 measurements were distributed within \u00b12 SD. This \nfinding suggests that the new TS-specific growth charts can be \nused for girls with TS with spontaneous puberty.\nThrough these processes, new TS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese girls were constructed\n8). We believe that the new TS-\nspecific charts can be presumed to be representative of growth \nin girls with TS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practices. In \naddition, these charts are the only TS-specific growth charts \nbased on an Asian population.\nDevelopment of growth charts in NS\nNS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome \nwith an estimated incidence of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 \nlive births\n27-29). The cardinal features of NS are distinctive facial \ncharacteristics that change with age, short stature, congenital \nheart disease, and chest deformity\n27,30). Clinical features of NS \ncan vary within a family, but become more subtle in adult life\n31). \nIndividuals with NS are typically treated by a multidisciplinary \nteam of specialists, which includes pediatric geneticists, \npediatric cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists.\nThe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling \npathway is an essential signaling pathway that controls cell \nproliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein-\ntyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene, \nwhich encodes a tyrosine phosphatase protein involved in \nthe Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, was identified as the first \ncausative gene in NS patients\n32). Increasing evidence indicates \nthat germline mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK \nsignaling pathway cause NS and Noonan-related syndrome\n33). \nWhile mutations in such genes have been identified in \napproximately 60%\u201370% of patients with NS\n34,35), the diagnosis \nof NS remains clinical\n27,36). Several scoring systems are currently \navailable for diagnosis, with the scoring system developed by \nvan der Burgt et al.\n37) in 1994 being the most widely used.\nGrowth patterns of children with NS are different from \nthose of the normal population. The mean birth length is \nslightly shorter, but within the normal range. However, a rapid \ndecline in length/height SD score (SDS) relative to the normal \npopulation develops during the first year of life. Thereafter, \nmean length/height lies approximately on the -2.5 SD line for \nthe normal population until age 12 years in boys and 10.5 years \nin girls. Afterwards, further decline becomes obvious due to \ndelayed puberty, and then the height SDS relative to the normal \npopulation tends to recover.\nNS-specific growth curves are currently available for 4 regions: \nBrazil, Europe, North America, and Japan\n9,10,38-40). Undoubtedly, \nNS-specific charts should be developed with data collected by \nmultidisciplinary specialists. Therefore, when we constructed \nNS-specific growth charts\n9,10), we conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of pediatric geneticists, pediatric cardiologists, and \npediatric endocrinologists responsible for Japanese NS patients. \nWe collaborated with three academic societies (i.e., The Japan \nSociety of Pediatric Genetics, The Japanese Society of Pediatric \nCardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and The Japanese Society for \nPediatric Endocrinology) and gathered data for NS patients \ndiagnosed by specialists from these societies at 31 hospitals \nnationwide. Due to secular trends in height, we recruited \npatients born in 1970 or later\n7). Questionnaires that included \nauxological measurements together with a minimal set of \nclinical and genetic data were sent to these hospitals. Height and \nweight measurements were gathered in a mixed longitudinal \nand cross-sectional manner. The minimal interval between 2 \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n243\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\nmeasurements was 1 month when the subjects were measured \nbefore 1 year of age or 3 months when measured after 1 year of \nage.\nTwenty of the 31 hospitals responded to our questionnaire, \nresulting in data for 356 clinically diagnosed NS patients. A total \nof 48 subjects were excluded because of missing auxological \ndata (n=26), presence of complications that might have affected \ngrowth (n=5), or extreme longitudinal growth aberrations \u00b13 \nSD from the mean (n=17). The remaining 308 subjects (159 \nboys, 149 girls) were analyzed. To develop the growth charts, \n3,249 measurements (boys, 1,674; girls, 1,575) were included \nafter exclusion of 23 measurements from three outliers. Height \nSDSs were not significantly different between individuals with \nand without genetic analysis (difference, 0.076; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.020 to 0.17; P=0.12). NS-specific growth charts \nwere constructed using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nSubjects were diagnosed with NS by certified specialists, \nand thus, diagnoses were very reliable. Moreover, diagnosis \nwas further validated by the scoring system developed by van \nder Burgt et al.\n37). All measurements were properly selected \nby excluding individuals with previous growth-promoting \ntreatment, complications that may affect growth, and extreme \nlongitudinal growth aberrations. Based on the NS-specific \ngrowth charts, adult height is 157.3\u00b17.4 cm for males (-2.3\u00b11.3 \nSDS) and 146.8\u00b16.9 cm for females (-2.1\u00b11.3 SDS). These adult \nheight SDSs for the normal population are comparable to values \nreported in other countries (male, -2.5 to -1.4; female, -2.2 to \n-1.8)\n38-42).\nThrough these processes, NS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese individuals were constructed\n9,10). We believe that \nthese charts can be presumed to be representative of growth in \nindividuals with NS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practice. \nMoreover, these are the only NS-specific growth charts based on \nmeasurements from an Asian population.\nStatistical method used for developing \ngrowth charts\nThe lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method\n43) was used for the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese \nindividuals with TS and NS. The LMS method is a standard \nmethod for establishing growth charts\n44) and is effective at \nconstructing reference charts that show the distribution of \na measurement as it changes by covariates such as age and \ntime. The LMS method includes smoothing with a spline \nfunction after normalizing age-specific data using a power \ntransformation. In this method, the degree of skewness (L), \nmedian (M), and coefficient of variation (S) are estimated by \nage, and SD scores (Z-scores) of each index can be calculated \nfrom the L, M, and S values. This method also allows the \ncalculation of percentiles, as SD scores can be converted to \npercentiles in a normal distribution. The LMS method is usually \nused for establishing growth charts based on cross-sectional \ndata. However, it can also be used for establishing growth \ncharts based on longitudinal data when the measurements are \nwidely scattered and there are no subjects with a nonnegligible \ninfluence on the charts\n9,45). In the data used for development of \ndisease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with TS \nand NS, numerous measurements were scattered across the age \nrange and all subjects had a significant influence on the growth \ncharts.\nDiscussion\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, it is essential \nto collect anthropometric measurements that reflect the true \ndisease population. Therefore, we made maximal efforts to \nobtain unbiased data for subjects with TS and NS that were \nrepresentative of overall TS and NS populations in Japan. Table \n2 summarizes the characteristics considered in the development \nof disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with \nTS and NS. For TS, we first utilized an existing nationwide \ncohort of TS patients before GH treatment in Japan. However, \nthis cohort did not represent the true population of TS due \nto diagnosis bias. To overcome this significant selection bias, \nwe compiled new hospital data in addition to the cohort data \nand analyzed both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. \nThese efforts have made the TS-specific charts closer to the \ntrue TS standards. For NS, there was not an existing cohort with \nanthropometric data. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide \nquestionnaire survey of multidisciplinary specialists, as NS is a \nclinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. As diagnosis \nof NS can be difficult, it was essential to have reliable diagnoses. \nTo do so, we only compiled data for subjects diagnosed by \ncertified specialists and validated the diagnosis using the \nscoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.\n37). Although \nthese efforts may not be perfect, we believe that the collected \nTable 2.

As the population of Japan is generally considered \nethnically homogeneous, we did not need to consider ethnicity \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. Theoretically, \nlocal TS and NS-specific growth charts would be most suitable \nfor individual growth monitoring in different countries. \nHowever, developing these charts can be difficult. It is of note \nthat there are no other disease-specific growth charts in TS and \nNS for Asian populations except for our charts. If our charts \nare used for other Asian populations, physicians should bear in \nmind how growth patterns in their countries differ from those \nin Japanese. For example, if our charts were utilized by Korean \nphysicians, they should know the difference in growth patterns \nbetween the two countries. Fig. 1 shows growth charts of the \nnormal Japanese population\n46) superimposed on the normal \nKorean population\n47). As the figure shows, there is considerable \noverlap except for younger and pubertal ages. Therefore, our TS \nand NS-specific growth charts might be applicable as long as \nphysicians are aware of the different growth patterns between \ntwo countries in the general population.\nConclusions\nDisease-specific growth charts are very useful tools. Theoreti\u00ad\ncally, these charts should be constructed for each ethnic group. \nHowever, gathering unbiased subject measurements is very \nchallenging. Here, we reviewed the development of disease-\nspecific charts for Japanese individuals with TS and NS. When \nusing disease-specific charts developed using data from other \nethnic groups, physicians should consider the underlying \ndifferences in normal growth patterns between ethnic groups.\nConflict of interest\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was \nreported.\nReferences \n1.\t\nHermanussen M.

As the growth patterns of affected \nindividuals differ from those of normal populations, it is challenging to detect \nadditional conditions that can influence growth using standard growth charts. \nDisease-specific growth charts are thus very useful tools and can be helpful for \nunderstanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis of congenital diseases. In \naddition, disease-specific growth charts allow doctors to detect deviations from \nthe usual growth patterns for early diagnosis of an additional condition and can \nbe used to evaluate the effects of growth-promoting treatment for patients. When \ndeveloping these charts, factors that can affect the reliability of the charts should \nbe considered. These factors include the definition of the disease with growth \nfailure, selection bias in the measurements used to develop the charts, secular \ntrends of the subjects, the numbers of subjects of varying ages and ethnicities, and \nthe statistical method used to develop the charts. In this review, we summarize the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with Turner \nsyndrome and Noonan syndrome and evaluate the efforts to collect unbiased \nmeasurements of subjects with these diseases. These charts were the only available \ndisease-specific growth charts of Turner syndrome and Noonan syndrome for Asian \npopulations and were developed using a Japanese population. Therefore, when \nthese charts are adopted for Asian populations other than Japanese, different \ngrowth patterns should be considered. \nKeywords: Growth charts, Disease-specific growth chart, Turner syndrome, Noonan \nsyndrome, LMS method, Asian population\nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\n1,\nSusumu Yokoya, MD, PhD\n2\n1Department of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, \nTokyo, \n2Fukushima Global Medical \nScience Center, Fukushima Medical \nUniversity, Fukushima, Japan\nhttps://doi.org/10.6065/apem.2017.22.4.240\nAnn Pediatr Endocrinol Metab 2017;22:240-246\n\u00a92017 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism\nReceived: 12 December, 2017\nAccepted: 18 December, 2017\nAddress for correspondence: \nTsuyoshi Isojima, MD, PhD\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Teikyo \nUniversity School of Medicine, 2-11-\n1 Kaga, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-8606, \nJapan\nTel: +81-3-3964-1211\nFax: +81-3-3579-8212\nE-mail: isojimat-tky@umin.ac.jp\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-0011-\n0325\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any \nmedium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nISSN: 2287-1012(Print) \nISSN: 2287-1292(Online) \nIntroduction\nGrowth charts are vital tools used worldwide for evaluating the growth of children in clinical \nsettings as well as public health examinations\n1,2). These charts enable physicians to compare the \ngrowth of an individual with that of the general population, assessing whether the individual \nhas growth failure or not. Starting with such assessment, a physician can investigate a specific \ndiagnosis for an individual with growth failure, although the diagnosis is usually determined \nby other findings such as clinical features, hormone levels, karyotyping, or bone radiographs.\nMany congenital diseases are associated with growth failure, and patients with these diseases \nshow characteristic growth patterns. As the growth patterns of affected individuals differ \nfrom those of the normal population, it is challenging to detect additional conditions that \ninfluence their growth using growth charts for the normal population. In clinical settings, it is \nessential for physicians to consider other possible contributory factors besides the established \ndiagnosis. To that end, disease-specific growth charts are very useful and are necessary for \nseveral reasons\n3). First, they are helpful for understanding the growth pattern and pathogenesis \nof a disease. Second, they enable the detection of deviations from typical growth patterns in \n\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n241\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\naffected individuals and aid in early diagnosis of additional \nconditions. Finally, they are very useful for evaluating the \neffects of growth-promoting treatment among patients. At \npresent, disease-specific growth charts are available for several \nsyndromes, such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, \nWilliams syndrome, Turner syndrome (TS), and Noonan \nsyndrome (NS)\n4-10).\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, we should \nconsider several factors that may affect the reliability of the \ncharts (Table 1). First, we should determine if the disease with \ngrowth failure can be precisely defined. If the pathogenesis \nor etiology of the disease is ambiguous, we cannot admit the \nsignificance of disease-specific growth charts. Second, we should \navoid selection bias in subject measurements whenever possible. \nIt often occurs that subjects recruited for measurements are not \nrepresentative of the overall disease population, as diagnoses \nare usually made after many symptoms manifest. Therefore, it \nis possible that the sample used for measurements is biased by \ndelayed diagnosis of the disease, and if we analyzed only cross-\nsectional data, the developed disease-specific growth charts \nmay show biased and different growth patterns. This will be \ndiscussed later in the example on the development of growth \ncharts in TS. Additional selection bias may derive from the \nspecialties of the physicians seeing the patients, which will be \ndiscussed later in the example of the development of growth \ncharts in NS. Briefly, in clinically heterogeneous disease such \nas NS where many specialists are involved in care, subject \nmeasurements should be obtained from multidisciplinary \nspecialists. In addition, the rearing environment of the subjects \nmay cause selection bias. Third, we should consider secular \ntrends among subjects when gathering data. For rare diseases, \nit can be difficult to recruit a sufficient number of patients. \nTherefore, we tend to recruit subjects over many years, which \ncan cause the developed disease-specific growth charts to be \naffected by secular growth trends. Fourth, we should collect \nmeasurements from a sufficient number of patients of all ages \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. If insufficient \nsubjects are available in certain age categories, a bump or a \ndip will be observed in the growth charts, which reflects the \nsampling error that occurs with a small number of subjects. \nFifth, we should consider that ethnicity can influence the \ngrowth of children with a disease. Finally, we should analyze \nprecise anthropometric data using proper statistical methods. \nConsidering all these factors, it seems almost impossible to \ncollect ideal data to establish true disease-specific standards. \nHowever, is it necessary to do so because disease-specific growth \nreferences remain meaningful tools for physicians in various \nclinical settings\n3). In this review, we summarize our experiences \ndeveloping disease-specific growth charts in TS\n8) and NS\n9,10).\nDevelopment of growth charts in TS\nTS is a chromosomal disorder occurring in females that is \ncharacterized by short stature and primary ovarian failure. It is \nthe most common chromosomal disorder in females, and the \nincidence is estimated at 1 in 1,500\u20132,500 live births\n11-13). TS is \ndefined by a karyotype that contains a cell line of monosomy \nlacking at least the distal major part of the short arm of one X \nchromosome. The growth patterns of TS girls are different from \nthose of normal individuals\n11-13). The birth length in TS is smaller \nthan that in normal populations due to mild growth delay in \nutero. After birth, the growth velocity gradually declines. The \nlength/height of girls with TS often remains within the normal \nrange during infancy, but usually falls below the fifth percentile \nof the normal population by the age of 5 years. Growth failure is \nmore evident as girls become mature, and growth spurts are not \nobserved during the expected pubertal period. Untreated adults \nwith TS are reported to be approximately 20 cm shorter than \nnormal female adults\n14).\nTS-specific growth charts are available in many coun\u00ad\ntries\n8,15-23). In Japan, the first TS-specific growth charts were \ndeveloped by Suwa\n20) in 1992. These charts were constructed \nusing data from 704 girls with TS (6,255 measurements) born \nfrom 1955 to 1989 (median unknown), meaning that most of \nthe analyzed subjects were born in 1972 or earlier. As the secular \ntrend of increasing height among Japanese children reached a \nplateau around 1990\n7), the TS-specific growth charts developed \nby Suwa\n20) became inappropriate for the evaluation of girls \nrecently diagnosed with TS. Thus, revisions to the charts were \nnecessary.\nFor the development of revised TS-specific growth charts, we \nutilized a database from the Foundation for Growth Science\n24). \nThis database controls for the use of growth hormone (GH) \nthrough its registration system and contains pretreatment data \nfor TS patients across Japan. After data cleaning and analyzing \npretreatment data for girls with TS born in 1970 or later, cross-\nsectional growth charts were constructed\n7). However, there was \na problem that the growth charts were shifted downward in \nyounger ages, which seemed to be due to selection bias. Girls \nwith TS who registered with the Foundation during infancy \ntended to be smaller than those who registered beyond infancy, \nbecause the degree of height difference between girls with TS \nand the normal population was smaller in infancy. On the other \nhand, girls with TS who registered at older ages might not have \nbeen affected by this selection bias because the height difference \nTable 1.

In brief, taller \nTS patients are often diagnosed only in older ages. To solve \nthis problem, data for relatively tall TS girls during infancy was \nneeded. To address this issue, we utilized semilongitudinal data \nfor girls with TS diagnosed at older ages. As the Foundation \ndatabase only included 3 consecutive years of data prior to GH \ntreatment, we could not obtain enough data from this source. \nTherefore, we collected new longitudinal data from the medical \nrecords of 205 girls with TS who sought treatment at 2 major \nhospitals in Tokyo (the National Center for Child Health and \nDevelopment and Toranomon Hospital) and used these data \nfor the revision of the growth charts. From the 2 datasets, 2,072 \nsubjects (born from 1970 to 2006, median 1985) were available. \nAfter excluding individuals who lacked the typical TS karyotype \n(n=31), those with spontaneous puberty (n=144), unknown \npuberty at the time of height and weight measurement (n=14), \na history of growth-promoting treatment (n=264), measured \nvalues exceeding \u00b15 standard deviation (SD) in the study \npopulation (n=4), and duplicate registration (n=50), 1,565 \nsubjects were retained for analysis. The presence of puberty was \njudged by statements in the application form (for Foundation \ndata) or the attainment of Tanner 2 breast development \n(for hospital data). Of the 5,796 measurements from 1,565 \nsubjects before growth-promoting treatment, an additional \n24 measurements were excluded because they fell outside \nthe range of \u00b15 SD of the population mean. New TS-specific \ngrowth charts were then constructed from the remaining 5,772 \nmeasurements using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nBased on the new TS-specific growth chart, the mean height \nof an adult female with TS is 141.3\u00b15.6 cm, which is comparable \nto data from other Japanese TS samples (e.g., 143.0\u00b14.9 cm, 18 \nTS females without GH treatment)\n26). According to the chart, \nindividuals with TS at the age of 20 years are, on average, -3.30 \nSD below the mean height for the normal population, which \nis similar to data from foreign countries (-2.54 to -4.15 SD)\n14). \nThese findings support the validity of the new TS-specific \ngrowth chart.\nGirls with TS with spontaneous puberty are significantly \ntaller than those without spontaneous puberty at the age of \n\u226512 years, but the difference is no longer significant when \nthey reach their adult height\n22). Thus, 2 types of growth charts \nmay be necessary during the peripubertal period. However, \nwe only produced TS-specific growth charts for girls without \nspontaneous puberty due to the limited number of pubertal \nsubjects. Nevertheless, when we plotted the measurements from \n144 subjects with spontaneous puberty on the new charts, all \nexcept for 5 measurements were distributed within \u00b12 SD. This \nfinding suggests that the new TS-specific growth charts can be \nused for girls with TS with spontaneous puberty.\nThrough these processes, new TS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese girls were constructed\n8). We believe that the new TS-\nspecific charts can be presumed to be representative of growth \nin girls with TS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practices. In \naddition, these charts are the only TS-specific growth charts \nbased on an Asian population.\nDevelopment of growth charts in NS\nNS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome \nwith an estimated incidence of between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 \nlive births\n27-29). The cardinal features of NS are distinctive facial \ncharacteristics that change with age, short stature, congenital \nheart disease, and chest deformity\n27,30). Clinical features of NS \ncan vary within a family, but become more subtle in adult life\n31). \nIndividuals with NS are typically treated by a multidisciplinary \nteam of specialists, which includes pediatric geneticists, \npediatric cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists.\nThe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling \npathway is an essential signaling pathway that controls cell \nproliferation, differentiation, and survival. The protein-\ntyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene, \nwhich encodes a tyrosine phosphatase protein involved in \nthe Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, was identified as the first \ncausative gene in NS patients\n32). Increasing evidence indicates \nthat germline mutations in genes involved in the Ras/MAPK \nsignaling pathway cause NS and Noonan-related syndrome\n33). \nWhile mutations in such genes have been identified in \napproximately 60%\u201370% of patients with NS\n34,35), the diagnosis \nof NS remains clinical\n27,36). Several scoring systems are currently \navailable for diagnosis, with the scoring system developed by \nvan der Burgt et al.\n37) in 1994 being the most widely used.\nGrowth patterns of children with NS are different from \nthose of the normal population. The mean birth length is \nslightly shorter, but within the normal range. However, a rapid \ndecline in length/height SD score (SDS) relative to the normal \npopulation develops during the first year of life. Thereafter, \nmean length/height lies approximately on the -2.5 SD line for \nthe normal population until age 12 years in boys and 10.5 years \nin girls. Afterwards, further decline becomes obvious due to \ndelayed puberty, and then the height SDS relative to the normal \npopulation tends to recover.\nNS-specific growth curves are currently available for 4 regions: \nBrazil, Europe, North America, and Japan\n9,10,38-40). Undoubtedly, \nNS-specific charts should be developed with data collected by \nmultidisciplinary specialists. Therefore, when we constructed \nNS-specific growth charts\n9,10), we conducted a nationwide \nsurvey of pediatric geneticists, pediatric cardiologists, and \npediatric endocrinologists responsible for Japanese NS patients. \nWe collaborated with three academic societies (i.e., The Japan \nSociety of Pediatric Genetics, The Japanese Society of Pediatric \nCardiology and Cardiac Surgery, and The Japanese Society for \nPediatric Endocrinology) and gathered data for NS patients \ndiagnosed by specialists from these societies at 31 hospitals \nnationwide. Due to secular trends in height, we recruited \npatients born in 1970 or later\n7). Questionnaires that included \nauxological measurements together with a minimal set of \nclinical and genetic data were sent to these hospitals. Height and \nweight measurements were gathered in a mixed longitudinal \nand cross-sectional manner. The minimal interval between 2 \n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n243\nIsojima T and Yokoya S \u2022 Disease-specific growth charts in TS and NS\nwww.e-apem.org\nmeasurements was 1 month when the subjects were measured \nbefore 1 year of age or 3 months when measured after 1 year of \nage.\nTwenty of the 31 hospitals responded to our questionnaire, \nresulting in data for 356 clinically diagnosed NS patients. A total \nof 48 subjects were excluded because of missing auxological \ndata (n=26), presence of complications that might have affected \ngrowth (n=5), or extreme longitudinal growth aberrations \u00b13 \nSD from the mean (n=17). The remaining 308 subjects (159 \nboys, 149 girls) were analyzed. To develop the growth charts, \n3,249 measurements (boys, 1,674; girls, 1,575) were included \nafter exclusion of 23 measurements from three outliers. Height \nSDSs were not significantly different between individuals with \nand without genetic analysis (difference, 0.076; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI], -0.020 to 0.17; P=0.12). NS-specific growth charts \nwere constructed using LMS Chartmaker Pro ver. 2.3 (Medical \nResearch Council, London, UK).\nSubjects were diagnosed with NS by certified specialists, \nand thus, diagnoses were very reliable. Moreover, diagnosis \nwas further validated by the scoring system developed by van \nder Burgt et al.\n37). All measurements were properly selected \nby excluding individuals with previous growth-promoting \ntreatment, complications that may affect growth, and extreme \nlongitudinal growth aberrations. Based on the NS-specific \ngrowth charts, adult height is 157.3\u00b17.4 cm for males (-2.3\u00b11.3 \nSDS) and 146.8\u00b16.9 cm for females (-2.1\u00b11.3 SDS). These adult \nheight SDSs for the normal population are comparable to values \nreported in other countries (male, -2.5 to -1.4; female, -2.2 to \n-1.8)\n38-42).\nThrough these processes, NS-specific growth charts for \nJapanese individuals were constructed\n9,10). We believe that \nthese charts can be presumed to be representative of growth in \nindividuals with NS who are ordinarily seen in clinical practice. \nMoreover, these are the only NS-specific growth charts based on \nmeasurements from an Asian population.\nStatistical method used for developing \ngrowth charts\nThe lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method\n43) was used for the \ndevelopment of disease-specific growth charts for Japanese \nindividuals with TS and NS. The LMS method is a standard \nmethod for establishing growth charts\n44) and is effective at \nconstructing reference charts that show the distribution of \na measurement as it changes by covariates such as age and \ntime. The LMS method includes smoothing with a spline \nfunction after normalizing age-specific data using a power \ntransformation. In this method, the degree of skewness (L), \nmedian (M), and coefficient of variation (S) are estimated by \nage, and SD scores (Z-scores) of each index can be calculated \nfrom the L, M, and S values. This method also allows the \ncalculation of percentiles, as SD scores can be converted to \npercentiles in a normal distribution. The LMS method is usually \nused for establishing growth charts based on cross-sectional \ndata. However, it can also be used for establishing growth \ncharts based on longitudinal data when the measurements are \nwidely scattered and there are no subjects with a nonnegligible \ninfluence on the charts\n9,45). In the data used for development of \ndisease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with TS \nand NS, numerous measurements were scattered across the age \nrange and all subjects had a significant influence on the growth \ncharts.\nDiscussion\nWhen developing disease-specific growth charts, it is essential \nto collect anthropometric measurements that reflect the true \ndisease population. Therefore, we made maximal efforts to \nobtain unbiased data for subjects with TS and NS that were \nrepresentative of overall TS and NS populations in Japan. Table \n2 summarizes the characteristics considered in the development \nof disease-specific growth charts for Japanese individuals with \nTS and NS. For TS, we first utilized an existing nationwide \ncohort of TS patients before GH treatment in Japan. However, \nthis cohort did not represent the true population of TS due \nto diagnosis bias. To overcome this significant selection bias, \nwe compiled new hospital data in addition to the cohort data \nand analyzed both cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. \nThese efforts have made the TS-specific charts closer to the \ntrue TS standards. For NS, there was not an existing cohort with \nanthropometric data. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide \nquestionnaire survey of multidisciplinary specialists, as NS is a \nclinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. As diagnosis \nof NS can be difficult, it was essential to have reliable diagnoses. \nTo do so, we only compiled data for subjects diagnosed by \ncertified specialists and validated the diagnosis using the \nscoring system developed by van der Burgt et al.\n37). Although \nthese efforts may not be perfect, we believe that the collected \nTable 2.

As the population of Japan is generally considered \nethnically homogeneous, we did not need to consider ethnicity \nwhen developing disease-specific growth charts. Theoretically, \nlocal TS and NS-specific growth charts would be most suitable \nfor individual growth monitoring in different countries. \nHowever, developing these charts can be difficult. It is of note \nthat there are no other disease-specific growth charts in TS and \nNS for Asian populations except for our charts. If our charts \nare used for other Asian populations, physicians should bear in \nmind how growth patterns in their countries differ from those \nin Japanese. For example, if our charts were utilized by Korean \nphysicians, they should know the difference in growth patterns \nbetween the two countries. Fig. 1 shows growth charts of the \nnormal Japanese population\n46) superimposed on the normal \nKorean population\n47). As the figure shows, there is considerable \noverlap except for younger and pubertal ages. Therefore, our TS \nand NS-specific growth charts might be applicable as long as \nphysicians are aware of the different growth patterns between \ntwo countries in the general population.\nConclusions\nDisease-specific growth charts are very useful tools. Theoreti\u00ad\ncally, these charts should be constructed for each ethnic group. \nHowever, gathering unbiased subject measurements is very \nchallenging. Here, we reviewed the development of disease-\nspecific charts for Japanese individuals with TS and NS. When \nusing disease-specific charts developed using data from other \nethnic groups, physicians should consider the underlying \ndifferences in normal growth patterns between ethnic groups.\nConflict of interest\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was \nreported.\nReferences \n1.\t\nHermanussen M.

To introduce a multidisciplinary approach for the management of COVID-19-infected \npatients and to report the first operated patient in the Corona unit.\nMethods\u2002 A detailed presentation of the hospital plan for a separate Corona unit with its intensive care unit and operating \nrooms. Description of the management of the first spine surgery case treated in this unit.\nResults\u2002 The Corona unit showed a practical approach for the management of an emergency cervical spine fracture-dislocation \nwith acute paralysis. The patient is 92-year-old female. The mechanism of injury was a simple fall during the stay in the \ninternal medicine department where the patient was treated in the referring hospital. The patient had no other injuries and \nwas awake and oriented. The patient did not have the clinical symptom of COVID-19, and the test result of COVID-19 done \nin the referring hospital was not available on admission in our emergency room. Education of the medical staff and organiza-\ntion of the operating theatre facilitated the management of the patient without an increased risk of spreading the infection.\nConclusions\u2002 The current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary organization of the medical and surgical care of \nthe patients. It is possible to manage an infected or a potentially infected patient surgically, but a multidisciplinary plan is \nnecessary to protect other patients and the medical staff.\nKeywords\u2002 COVID-19\u00a0\u00b7 Emergency\u00a0\u00b7 Cervical fracture\u00a0\u00b7 Corona ward\u00a0\u00b7 Surgical planning\nIntroduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019\nIn late 2019, a series of severe acute respiratory syndrome \n(SARS) was reported in China. The causative organism was \ndetected, and the term Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) was introduced [1, 2]. A few weeks later, the number \nof cases increased dramatically. Cases outside China were \ndetected [3]. Confirmation of human-to-human transmis-\nsion leads to the application of specific measures to reduce \nthe rate of infection and thus to allow medical systems to \nmanage the exponential demand on intensive care beds for \nsuch patients. By 11 March 2020, as the number of countries \ninvolved reached 114 with more than 118,000 cases and over \n4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status [4].\nStart of\u00a0national measures in\u00a0Germany\nOn Monday, 27 January 2020, a Chinese woman from \nShanghai informed the company she was working for in \nBavaria about her Coronavirus infection. Her German col-\nleague was then tested positive. He was the first confirmed \ncase in Germany [5]. Starting from this day, the national \nauthorities in Germany started a general plan to prepare the \nmedical system for a dangerous situation [6, 7].\nFirst, the hospitals were prepared to accommodate many \nseriously ill Corona patients under high pressure.

Before the Corona crisis, there were \n28,000 intensive care beds nationwide in Germany, includ-\ning 20,000 with ventilation. These were occupied on average \nof 70\u201380 percent. The intensive care capacity is divided into \nintermediate care units (IMC) where most patients are not \nventilated and mainly for peri-operative care, and patients \nwith a medical condition not suitable for a peripheral sta-\ntion. Most IMC beds can be converted into ventilation units \nas the ventilators are available. The second category is the \nintensive care units (ICU), where all beds are equipped with \nventilators. Before the pandemic, patients in both IMC and \nICU were not all on ventilators [8].\nCapacities were then expanded nationwide. Efforts were \nmade in all hospitals, supported by central measures taken \nby the Federal Ministry of Health, to create further ventila-\ntion places in the medium term and to supply additional \nventilation devices. The number of intensive care beds did \nincrease to 40,000 and the ventilation places to 30,000.\nSecond, the elective surgical procedures were rescheduled \nto allow hospitals to manage the expected increase in the \nnumber of COVID-19 patients and to avoid the postoperative \nincreased risk of infection, especially after major operative \ninterventions with reduced postoperative immune system \nresponse.\nThird, educational and practical measures were under-\ntaken in each hospital, including information and training \nof employees, the examination of stocks and stockpiling \nwith personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals and \ndisinfectants. Besides, detailed information for patients and \nvisitors and travelling history for each person, together with \nthe expansion of COVID-19 tests, were further measures \nundertaken.\nThe German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive \nCare and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Robert Koch \nInstitute (RKI) and the German Hospital Society (DKG) \nhave activated together with the DIVI intensive care reg-\nister. This website registers and queries for free ventilation \nplaces in all clinics in Germany to optimize the cooperation \nbetween the hospitals and to provide a real overview of the \nintensive bed situation in the nation [9\u201311].\nIn our hospital, we have an intermediate care unit (IMC) \nwith a capacity of 40 beds. The IMC is divided into a surgi-\ncal IMC for peri-operative care and a medical IMC for car-\ndiac and pulmonary patients that are medically not suitable \nfor a peripheral station. Almost all patients in the IMC are \nnot on a ventilator, but 30 beds are equipped with a venti-\nlator. Besides, there are 35 beds in the intensive care unit \n(ICU). These beds are all equipped with a ventilator. This \nexplains the high ventilation capacity in the German medical \nsystem. Stopping the elective operation resulted in a very \nrapid increase of the IMC capacity within one or two days \nas most postoperative patients leave the IMC within the first \n24\u00a0h postoperatively.\nMethods\nChanges in\u00a0spine surgery practice\nIn our hospital, the spine surgery department has resched-\nuled all elective operations. The surgical intervention was \nlimited to four categories of spine disorders. The first group \nconsisted of patients with unstable spine fractures. The sec-\nond group included patients presenting with acute paralysis \ndue to spinal canal stenosis or disc prolapse. The third cat-\negory was spinal oncology, and the fourth group was spon-\ndylodiscitis patients presenting with sepsis or neurological \ndeficits. Outpatient visits were limited to patients with a \nplanned first postoperative examination or patients present-\ning with acute spine disorders or intractable symptoms. The \nwaiting area for the outpatient clinic was modified to pre-\nvent close contact between patients, and the appointments \nwere terminated to limit the waiting time before meeting the \ntreating doctors. In addition, all visiting patients were asked \nabout their travel history as well as about the presence of any \nrespiratory symptoms or fever. All these measures aimed to \nreduce the local spread of infection among our patients as \nwell as to protect our medical staff.\nCorona department\nThe hospital crisis team developed an emergency plan for \npatients with COVID-19. A separate emergency room with \na separate entrance was organized (the Corona emergency \nroom). An isolation station was further prepared for posi-\ntively tested patients. This station consisted of two units: \none with standard isolation rooms, and the other consisted \nof isolation intensive care beds. This isolation station was \nconnected to two operating theatres for emergency surgical \ninterventions. These Corona theatres were equipped with \nan operating microscope, as well as two C-arms. Suspected \ncases waiting for the result of the PCR test were admitted in \nthe Corona station but separately isolated rooms.\nA well-defined strategy for patients\u2019 referral was then \nestablished. Any hospital seeking patient transfer to our \nhospital was asked to perform a PCR COVID test within \n48\u00a0h before transmission, to admit the transferred patient at \nthe right place in our hospital. With a negative test, patients \nwere admitted to the ordinary hospital departments. In the \ncase of a positive test, patients were admitted to the Corona \nunit.\nAn emergency referral was addressed in a different \nway. Emergency cases were defined to be patients with \n\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n470\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nneurological deficits, sepsis or unstable spine. These patients \nwere transferred without the COVID-19 test. The test was \nthen performed on arrival, and the patients were operated \nwhen needed in the Corona theatre. All of them were man-\naged as Corona positive in the special station for suspected \ncases till otherwise proved.\nStaff protecting measures\nThe protection of the staff is a priority to maintain adequate \ncontinuous medical service for the patients. In our hospital, \nwe passed two phases; the first phase was at the beginning \nof the pandemic. Persons who were on vacation or visited \na risk zone and have no symptoms were instructed to stay \n14\u00a0days in home isolation and can start working when stay-\ning symptom-free. People who have respiratory symptoms \nare immediately tested and were instructed to avoid working \nuntil the results were available. In the first three weeks, we \ndid not have any positive cases in our staff.\nThe second phase started after the organization of the \nCorona unit. The medical staff is educated to be able to deal \nwith infected or potentially infected patients. The staff is \ninstructed to enter the hospital through a separate entrance. \nProtective medical supplies like masks and eye protection \ntools are available. The medical staff and the service person \nshould wear a mask during the whole duty time. The hospital \nrestaurant and caf\u00e9 were closed. The gathering is limited to \nthe minimum, and all should wear a mask. Meetings and \ncommunications between different departments were con-\nverted to video conferences or telephone meetings. Persons \nwith any respiratory symptoms are immediately tested for \nCOVID-19 and are not allowed to work until the results are \navailable. Any medical staff that had contact with a positive \nperson outside the hospital was instructed to have 14\u00a0days \nof home isolation.\nPatients protecting measures (Fig.\u00a01)\nOn admission, the COVID-19-positive patients are directed \nto the Corona ER and then to the separate isolation rooms or \nICU isolation rooms. Patients should wear a protective mask \nduring the stay outside the isolation rooms for any diagnos-\ntic procedure. The pathway in the hospital is planned, and \nthe staff follows an exact route for connection between the \ndifferent diagnostic and intervention rooms in the hospital. \nThe main concern is the Corona-suspected patients as they \nmay get the infection in the hospital. The suspected patients \nare managed in two ways, first as a source of infection. The \npersonal measures are taken to avoid transmission to other \npatients and our staff. Second, the patient should be pro-\ntected from the confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. The \nisolation rooms are separated in a way to prevent any contact \nbetween patients. The medical staff is not allowed to enter \nthe isolation unit of different patients without a complete \nchange of the protective measures, and proper disinfection \nmust be done between every patient. Once the COVID-19 \nFig.\u202f1\u2002 \u2009The construction of the Corona unit with the separate isolation rooms and ICU units for confirmed positive cases and suspected cases. \nThe two Corona operation rooms are connected to the unit\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n471\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\t\n1 3\ntest is available (12\u201324\u00a0h), the patient is transferred to a \nsuitable place in the hospital. Family visits are prohibited \nfor all patients during the hospital stay with the exception \nof terminal patients and patients in the palliative oncology \ndepartment, and the visitors should be symptom-free and \nwear a protective mask.\nIn this report, we are presenting the first spine emergency \nsurgical intervention in a patient with suspected COVID-19.\nResults\nCase presentation (Fig.\u00a02)\nOn 22 April 2020, a 92-year-old female patient was referred \nto our emergency department with acute paraplegia after \ncervical spine trauma. The trauma was in the form of falling \nduring her hospital stay in the internal medicine department \nin the referring hospital. The patient was acutely referred \nto our hospital before the result of the COVID-19 test was \navailable.\nWe considered the case as suspected COVID-19. The \npatient was immediately admitted to the Corona emergency \nroom two hours after trauma. On admission, the patient had \na rigid cervical spine collar and was awake with Glasgow \ncoma scale 15. The neurological examination showed \nincomplete paraplegia below the neurological level of C6 \n(ASIA B). Before the trauma, the patient was independent, \nand she had no significant associated medical disease. CT \nscan was performed in the referring hospital, and cervical \nspine MRI was immediately performed in the emergency \ndepartment (Fig.\u00a01). A traumatic fracture-dislocation C5-6 \nwith spinal cord oedema was diagnosed. As the patient had \nan unstable fracture with acute paralysis, the decision for an \nemergency surgical intervention was made [12]. A poste-\nrior open reduction and stabilization combined with anterior \ndecompression and fusion were planed.\nModifications in\u00a0the\u00a0Corona operating \nrooms\nBefore surgery\nThe Corona unit has two equipped operating rooms. One \nroom is reserved for suspected patients, and the other room \nis for the confirmed cases. Measures are taken to prevent \nunnecessary movement of the staff. The instruments are pre-\npared adequately to avoid the need for springing between \nrooms.

The medical staff is trained for the proper \ndealing with the infected material during the operation. The \nnumber of persons in the operating room is reduced to a \nminimum. Patients are transferred to the Corona operating \nrooms under strict hygienic measures wearing a surgical \nmask and eye protection.\nDuring intubation and\u00a0surgery (Fig.\u00a03)\nThe anaesthesia staff wears the same protective measures as \nthe surgical staff. During intubation, only the staff involved \nin the procedure are allowed to enter the operating room. \nEndotracheal intubation, guided by a video laryngoscope \nwith a disposable cover, is recommended. Disconnection \nof the patient for positioning should, when possible, be \navoided. When disconnection is necessary, the ventilator \nfilter must remain connected to the tube on the patients\u2019 \nside to avoid the dissemination of infection. After intubation, \na wet compress covers the patient\u2019s face to reduce the pos-\nsibility of infection transmission. The surgical team should \nreduce the use of cauterization and use the suction system \nproperly. Extubation should be performed in the operating \nroom and under the same measures used during intubation. \nThe patient should wear a protective mask as soon as pos-\nsible after the extubation.\nAfter surgery\nThe surgical and anaesthesia staff are trained to take off the \nprotective measures under the strict hygienic procedure. \nAdditional help through another person is necessary to avoid \ncontact with the infected masks, goggles and gowns during \nthe removal of the protective material. The used instruments \nare separately sterilized. The potentially infected materials \nused during the operation, including surgical drapes, gowns, \ngloves and masks, were collected in separate trash with a \ndouble closure for proper disposal. The body fluids and the \ntissue material of the operated patients are also eliminated in \nthe same way. After the procedure, all filters in the anaesthe-\nsia machine are removed and changed. The room is appro-\npriately webbed and disinfected. The service persons are \ntrained to deal with the infected materials and to perform \nthe proper postoperative disinfection. The operating room \nremains closed for a minimum of four hours after the surgi-\ncal procedure to reduce the possibility of infection transmis-\nsion for the next patient. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 \ntest stay in the Corona isolation unit until the improvement \nof the clinical symptoms and two negative COVID-19 tests \n48 h apart. The maximum isolation time for a suspected \npatient is until the test results are available in 12 to 24\u00a0h.\nOperative profile of\u00a0the\u00a0presented case\nThe time between hospital admission and operation was \n135\u00a0min. The posterior approach with open reduction of the \nfacet joint dislocation, posterior decompression and lateral \nmass screw fixation took 115\u00a0min. Anterior discectomy \nC6/7 with decompression and cage augmented fusion took \n40\u00a0min. Operative blood loss was 450\u00a0ml (300\u00a0ml posterior \nand 150\u00a0ml anterior). There were no intraoperative compli-\ncations. The patient was extubated in the operation theatre \nunder strict hygienic measures and then was transferred to \nthe ICU of the Corona unit. Postoperatively, no change in \nFig.\u202f3\u2002 \u2009Operating room setting during the operation.

On the first \npostoperative day (12\u00a0h postoperatively), the result of the \nCOVID-19 test was negative. The patient had no respiratory \nsymptoms and was transferred from the suspected region of \nthe Corona ICU to the normal intermediate care unit (IMC) \nfor postoperative observation. The patient was transferred on \nthe third postoperative day to the paraplegia rehabilitation \nclinic. Two weeks postoperatively, the patient had partial \nsensory improvement.\nDiscussion\nTriage during\u00a0the\u00a0pandemic\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has induced many changes in the \npractice of spine surgery. Postponement of elective spine \nsurgeries in order to save hospital capacities for COVID-19 \npatients as well as to prevent nosocomial infections of elec-\ntive patients was undertaken in our institution. We excluded \nfour categories from the postponement plan, namely: neu-\nrological deficits, spondylodiscitis, tumours and fractures. \nThere is a consensus about the importance of such measures \namong most of the surgeons worldwide [13]. A comparable \nplan was undertaken by Soh et\u00a0al. in Singapore, who reduced \ntheir elective lists to about 50% of the norm and postponed \ndeformity and complex revision cases. Donnally et\u00a0al. pub-\nlished the Rothman Institute guidelines for spine surgery in \nthe COVID-19 era [14]. They recommended triaging spinal \noperations into three levels. They recommended the surgery \nin the hospital for level I emergency cases, postponement of \nsurgery for level III elective cases and surgery at ambulatory \nsurgical centres for level II, including degenerative patholo-\ngies with intractable pain. In our experience, we underwent \nan individual discussion with these level II patients with \nclarification of the possible risks, and when the decision for \nsurgery was taken, this was then performed in the hospital. \nThe same recommendation was given by Jain et\u00a0al. [15], \nwho again adapted a guide to outlining a triaging system of \nspine-specific surgical care. The crucial prerequisite to make \nthese guidelines applicable is the availability of adequate \nhealthcare resources to safely perform the procedures.\nOperating room considerations\nDedicated operating theatres for COVID-19 patients are \nutilized in our hospital. These theatres are well equipped \nwith an operating microscope and two C-arms. This step \ntook place at the very beginning of the pandemic, and \nthe rooms remained unused, waiting only for COVID-19 \npatients. The same concept has been recommended by Soh \net\u00a0al. [13] as well as Jain et\u00a0al. [15]. In case of emergency, \ndelaying the surgery waiting for the COVID test is not \nclinically permissible. The case presented in this work \nwith cervical spine fracture-dislocation reflects the impor-\ntance of such measures. This plan helps to achieve the best \nmedical service for any patient without any potential risk \nof increasing virus transmission.\nPerspectives for\u00a0the\u00a0near\u00a0future\nDonnally et\u00a0al. [14] emphasized the fact that surgical \ndelays should not be assumed to be for a short time. The \nrisk of postponing a spine surgery should be assessed, \nunderstanding that eventual surgery may occur in \n3\u20134\u00a0months later. In our hands, the decision for delaying \nsurgery is taken after a thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s \nradiological examinations and records as well as after a \nphone conversation with each patient to get informed about \nhis actual state regarding the spine as well as the accom-\npanying social and medical aspects. Furthermore, the role \nof telemedicine is getting more critical in our hospital. \nWe increased the number of institutions connected to our \ndepartment to offer more telemedical service. The online \nconsultation, together with teleradiological connections, \nbecame a standard option besides the usual phone calls. \nRecommendations and regulations regarding the safe use \nof telemedicine are evolving to ensure both patient data \nprotection and the possibility to minimize the unnecessary \nvisits and patient transfer between hospitals [16].\nOnce an urgent surgery is performed, we aim to reduce \nthe hospital stay to a minimum to decrease the strain on \nour hospital beds and healthcare resources. The case \npresented in this work was operated upon 135\u00a0min after \nadmission and was then transferred postoperatively after \nthree days to the paraplegic rehabilitation clinic, which \nwas also beneficial to the patient to enhance neurological \nrecovery. Soh et\u00a0al. [13] recommended the same concept \nin their publication. They highlighted the current climate \nof economic uncertainty, and that shorter hospital stays \nwould allow keeping healthcare costs down for patients \nand the nation. We recommend maintaining this strategy \neven after the pandemic as rapid discharge may reduce the \npossibility of in-hospital infections and reduce the cost for \npatients and the medical system.\nA last aspect for the future is the extension of telemedi-\ncine service to include surgical interventions. Tian et\u00a0al. [17] \nrecently published their experience with telerobotic spinal \nsurgery based on 5G technology. They performed remote \nsurgery in 12 cases and concluded that this technology could \nbuild a connection between surgeons and patients located in \nisolated or rural areas with a lack of medical resources. We \ndo not have experience with this technology; however, this \nmight be an attractive option in such pandemic situations \nprovided the necessary infrastructures are available.\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n474\n\t\nEuropean Spine Journal (2021) 30:468\u2013474\n1 3\nElective spine operations, is\u00a0it the\u00a0right time?\nIn the last few weeks, the number of new cases is signifi-\ncantly reduced. We started to perform elective surgeries \nunder close communication with the intensive care and \nanaesthesia departments. The prerequisites are the availabil-\nity of ICU reserve and the presence of adequate capacity in \nthe Corona unit. In the last few days, new publications are \ndiscussing starting the elective operations during the pan-\ndemic [18, 19]. The main recommendations are summarized \nin this conclusion; elective surgery resumption should be \ncautious, especially in the area of pandemic focus. Elective \nsurgery should ideally be strictly performed in a COVID-\nfree facility, and hospital stay should be as short as possible. \nPatients operated first should be carefully selected according \nto COVID exposure, age, ASA physical status classification \nsystem/risk factors, socio-professional situation and surgical \nindication. At the suspicion of COVID symptoms, elective \nsurgery should be postponed. In the case of surgery, close \nmonitoring of COVID-19 signs and adapted personal protec-\ntive equipment is recommended [18].\nConclusion\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic requires an extra-ordinary \norganization of the medical and surgical care of the patients. \nIt is possible to manage a potentially infected patient surgi-\ncally, but a multidisciplinary plan is necessary to protect \nother patients and the medical staff.\nCompliance with ethical standards\u2002\nConflict of interest\u2002 On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author \nstates that there is no conflict of interest.\nReferences\n\t 1.\t Lu H, Stratton CW, Tang YW (2020) Outbreak of pneumonia of \nunknown etiology in Wuhan, China: the mystery and the miracle. \nJ Med Virol 92(4):401\u2013402. https\u200b://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25678\u200b\n\t 2.\t Di Gennaro F, Pizzol D, Marotta C, Antunes M, Racalbuto V, \nVeronese N, Smith L (2020) Coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) \ncurrent status and future perspectives: a narrative review.
